WOOD MICE ARE PRIMARILY SEED EATERS, PARTICULARLY SEEDS OF TREES SUCH AS OAK, BEECH, ASH, LIME, HAWTHORN, AND SYCAMORE. IF SEEDS ARE PLENTIFUL ON THE GROUND, THEY CARRY THEM BACK TO THEIR NESTS/BURROWS FOR STORAGE. THEY MAY EAT SMALL INVERTEBRATES SUCH AS SNAILS AND INSECTS, PARTICULARLY IN LATE SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER WHEN SEEDS ARE LEAST AVAILABLE. LATER IN THE SEASON THEY WILL EAT BERRIES, FRUITS, FUNGI AND ROOTS. IN WINTER, THEY MAY PREY ON HIBERNATING BATS.
