BOOK ONETHE COMING OF THE MARTIANSCHAPTER ONETHE EVE OF THE WARNO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IN THE LAST YEARS OF THE NINETEENTHCENTURY THAT THIS WORLD WAS BEING WATCHED KEENLY AND CLOSELY BYINTELLIGENCES GREATER THAN MANS AND YET AS MORTAL AS HIS OWN THAT ASMEN BUSIED THEMSELVES ABOUT THEIR VARIOUS CONCERNS THEY WERESCRUTINISED AND STUDIED PERHAPS ALMOST AS NARROWLY AS A MAN WITH AMICROSCOPE MIGHT SCRUTINISE THE TRANSIENT CREATURES THAT SWARM ANDMULTIPLY IN A DROP OF WATER  WITH INFINITE COMPLACENCY MEN WENT TOAND FRO OVER THIS GLOBE ABOUT THEIR LITTLE AFFAIRS SERENE IN THEIRASSURANCE OF THEIR EMPIRE OVER MATTER  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEINFUSORIA UNDER THE MICROSCOPE DO THE SAME  NO ONE GAVE A THOUGHT TOTHE OLDER WORLDS OF SPACE AS SOURCES OF HUMAN DANGER OR THOUGHT OFTHEM ONLY TO DISMISS THE IDEA OF LIFE UPON THEM AS IMPOSSIBLE ORIMPROBABLE  IT IS CURIOUS TO RECALL SOME OF THE MENTAL HABITS OFTHOSE DEPARTED DAYS  AT MOST TERRESTRIAL MEN FANCIED THERE MIGHT BEOTHER MEN UPON MARS PERHAPS INFERIOR TO THEMSELVES AND READY TOWELCOME A MISSIONARY ENTERPRISE  YET ACROSS THE GULF OF SPACE MINDSTHAT ARE TO OUR MINDS AS OURS ARE TO THOSE OF THE BEASTS THAT PERISHINTELLECTS VAST AND COOL AND UNSYMPATHETIC REGARDED THIS EARTH WITHENVIOUS EYES AND SLOWLY AND SURELY DREW THEIR PLANS AGAINST US  ANDEARLY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY CAME THE GREAT DISILLUSIONMENTTHE PLANET MARS I SCARCELY NEED REMIND THE READER REVOLVES ABOUT THESUN AT A MEAN DISTANCE OF  MILES AND THE LIGHT AND HEAT ITRECEIVES FROM THE SUN IS BARELY HALF OF THAT RECEIVED BY THIS WORLDIT MUST BE IF THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS HAS ANY TRUTH OLDER THAN OURWORLD AND LONG BEFORE THIS EARTH CEASED TO BE MOLTEN LIFE UPON ITSSURFACE MUST HAVE BEGUN ITS COURSE  THE FACT THAT IT IS SCARCELY ONESEVENTH OF THE VOLUME OF THE EARTH MUST HAVE ACCELERATED ITS COOLINGTO THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH LIFE COULD BEGIN  IT HAS AIR AND WATERAND ALL THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE SUPPORT OF ANIMATED EXISTENCEYET SO VAIN IS MAN AND SO BLINDED BY HIS VANITY THAT NO WRITERUP TO THE VERY END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY EXPRESSED ANY IDEA THATINTELLIGENT LIFE MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED THERE FAR OR INDEED AT ALLBEYOND ITS EARTHLY LEVEL  NOR WAS IT GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT SINCEMARS IS OLDER THAN OUR EARTH WITH SCARCELY A QUARTER OF THESUPERFICIAL AREA AND REMOTER FROM THE SUN IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWS THATIT IS NOT ONLY MORE DISTANT FROM TIMES BEGINNING BUT NEARER ITS ENDTHE SECULAR COOLING THAT MUST SOMEDAY OVERTAKE OUR PLANET HASALREADY GONE FAR INDEED WITH OUR NEIGHBOUR  ITS PHYSICAL CONDITION ISSTILL LARGELY A MYSTERY BUT WE KNOW NOW THAT EVEN IN ITS EQUATORIALREGION THE MIDDAY TEMPERATURE BARELY APPROACHES THAT OF OUR COLDESTWINTER  ITS AIR IS MUCH MORE ATTENUATED THAN OURS ITS OCEANS HAVESHRUNK UNTIL THEY COVER BUT A THIRD OF ITS SURFACE AND AS ITS SLOWSEASONS CHANGE HUGE SNOWCAPS GATHER AND MELT ABOUT EITHER POLE ANDPERIODICALLY INUNDATE ITS TEMPERATE ZONES  THAT LAST STAGE OFEXHAUSTION WHICH TO US IS STILL INCREDIBLY REMOTE HAS BECOME APRESENTDAY PROBLEM FOR THE INHABITANTS OF MARS  THE IMMEDIATEPRESSURE OF NECESSITY HAS BRIGHTENED THEIR INTELLECTS ENLARGED THEIRPOWERS AND HARDENED THEIR HEARTS  AND LOOKING ACROSS SPACE WITHINSTRUMENTS AND INTELLIGENCES SUCH AS WE HAVE SCARCELY DREAMED OFTHEY SEE AT ITS NEAREST DISTANCE ONLY  OF MILES SUNWARD OFTHEM A MORNING STAR OF HOPE OUR OWN WARMER PLANET GREEN WITHVEGETATION AND GREY WITH WATER WITH A CLOUDY ATMOSPHERE ELOQUENT OFFERTILITY WITH GLIMPSES THROUGH ITS DRIFTING CLOUD WISPS OF BROADSTRETCHES OF POPULOUS COUNTRY AND NARROW NAVYCROWDED SEASAND WE MEN THE CREATURES WHO INHABIT THIS EARTH MUST BE TO THEMAT LEAST AS ALIEN AND LOWLY AS ARE THE MONKEYS AND LEMURS TO US  THEINTELLECTUAL SIDE OF MAN ALREADY ADMITS THAT LIFE IS AN INCESSANTSTRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS TOO IS THE BELIEFOF THE MINDS UPON MARS  THEIR WORLD IS FAR GONE IN ITS COOLING ANDTHIS WORLD IS STILL CROWDED WITH LIFE BUT CROWDED ONLY WITH WHAT THEYREGARD AS INFERIOR ANIMALS  TO CARRY WARFARE SUNWARD IS INDEEDTHEIR ONLY ESCAPE FROM THE DESTRUCTION THAT GENERATION AFTERGENERATION CREEPS UPON THEMAND BEFORE WE JUDGE OF THEM TOO HARSHLY WE MUST REMEMBER WHATRUTHLESS AND UTTER DESTRUCTION OUR OWN SPECIES HAS WROUGHT NOT ONLYUPON ANIMALS SUCH AS THE VANISHED BISON AND THE DODO BUT UPON ITSINFERIOR RACES  THE TASMANIANS IN SPITE OF THEIR HUMAN LIKENESSWERE ENTIRELY SWEPT OUT OF EXISTENCE IN A WAR OF EXTERMINATION WAGEDBY EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS IN THE SPACE OF FIFTY YEARS  ARE WE SUCHAPOSTLES OF MERCY AS TO

MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READYDURING THE OPPOSITION OF  A GREAT LIGHT WAS SEEN ON THEILLUMINATED PART OF THE DISK FIRST AT THE LICK OBSERVATORY THEN BYPERROTIN OF NICE AND THEN BY OTHER OBSERVERS  ENGLISH READERS HEARDOF IT FIRST IN THE ISSUE OF NATURE DATED AUGUST   I AM INCLINED TOTHINK THAT THIS BLAZE MAY HAVE BEEN THE CASTING OF THE HUGE GUN INTHE VAST PIT SUNK INTO THEIR PLANET FROM WHICH THEIR SHOTS WERE FIREDAT US  PECULIAR MARKINGS AS YET UNEXPLAINED WERE SEEN NEAR THE SITEOF THAT OUTBREAK DURING THE NEXT TWO OPPOSITIONSTHE STORM BURST UPON US SIX YEARS AGO NOW  AS MARS APPROACHEDOPPOSITION LAVELLE OF JAVA SET THE WIRES OF THE ASTRONOMICAL EXCHANGEPALPITATING WITH THE AMAZING INTELLIGENCE OF A HUGE OUTBREAK OFINCANDESCENT GAS UPON THE PLANET  IT HAD OCCURRED TOWARDS MIDNIGHT OFTHE TWELFTH AND THE SPECTROSCOPE TO WHICH HE HAD AT ONCE RESORTEDINDICATED A MASS OF FLAMING GAS CHIEFLY HYDROGEN MOVING WITH ANENORMOUS VELOCITY TOWARDS THIS EARTH  THIS JET OF FIRE HAD BECOMEINVISIBLE ABOUT A QUARTER PAST TWELVE  HE COMPARED IT TO A COLOSSALPUFF OF FLAME SUDDENLY AND VIOLENTLY SQUIRTED OUT OF THE PLANET ASFLAMING GASES RUSHED OUT OF A GUNA SINGULARLY APPROPRIATE PHRASE IT PROVED  YET THE NEXT DAY THEREWAS NOTHING OF THIS IN THE PAPERS EXCEPT A LITTLE NOTE IN THE DAILYTELEGRAPH AND THE WORLD WENT IN IGNORANCE OF ONE OF THE GRAVESTDANGERS THAT EVER THREATENED THE HUMAN RACE I MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD OFTHE ERUPTION AT ALL HAD I NOT MET OGILVY THE WELLKNOWN ASTRONOMERAT OTTERSHAW  HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS AND IN THE EXCESSOF HIS FEELINGS INVITED ME UP TO TAKE A TURN WITH HIM THAT NIGHT IN ASCRUTINY OF THE RED PLANETIN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE I STILL REMEMBER THATVIGIL VERY DISTINCTLY THE BLACK AND SILENT OBSERVATORY THE SHADOWEDLANTERN THROWING A FEEBLE GLOW UPON THE FLOOR IN THE CORNER THESTEADY TICKING OF THE CLOCKWORK OF THE TELESCOPE THE LITTLE SLIT INTHE ROOFAN OBLONG PROFUNDITY WITH THE STARDUST STREAKED ACROSS ITOGILVY MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT AUDIBLE  LOOKING THROUGH THETELESCOPE ONE SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANETSWIMMING IN THE FIELD  IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT ANDSMALL AND STILL FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLYFLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND  BUT SO LITTLE IT WAS SO SILVERYWARMA PINSHEAD OF LIGHT IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THISWAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING WITH THE ACTIVITY OF THE CLOCKWORK THATKEPT THE PLANET IN VIEWAS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER AND TOADVANCE AND RECEDE BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY THAT MY EYE WAS TIRED  FORTYMILLIONS OF MILES IT WAS FROM USMORE THAN FORTY MILLIONS OF MILES OFVOID  FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY IN WHICH THE DUSTOF THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE SWIMSNEAR IT IN THE FIELD I REMEMBER WERE THREE FAINT POINTS OF LIGHTTHREE TELESCOPIC STARS INFINITELY REMOTE AND ALL AROUND IT WAS THEUNFATHOMABLE DARKNESS OF EMPTY SPACE  YOU KNOW HOW THAT BLACKNESSLOOKS ON A FROSTY STARLIGHT NIGHT  IN A TELESCOPE IT SEEMS FARPROFOUNDER  AND INVISIBLE TO ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO REMOTE AND SMALLFLYING SWIFTLY AND STEADILY TOWARDS ME ACROSS THAT INCREDIBLEDISTANCE DRAWING NEARER EVERY MINUTE BY SO MANY THOUSANDS OF MILESCAME THE THING THEY WERE SENDING US THE THING THAT WAS TO BRING SOMUCH STRUGGLE AND CALAMITY AND DEATH TO THE EARTH  I NEVER DREAMED OFIT THEN AS I WATCHED NO ONE ON EARTH DREAMED OF THAT UNERRINGMISSILETHAT NIGHT TOO THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THEDISTANT PLANET  I SAW IT  A REDDISH FLASH AT THE EDGE THE SLIGHTESTPROJECTION OF THE OUTLINE JUST AS THE CHRONOMETER STRUCK MIDNIGHT ANDAT THAT I TOLD OGILVY AND HE TOOK MY PLACE  THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND IWAS THIRSTY AND I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAYIN THE DARKNESS TO THE LITTLE TABLE WHERE THE SIPHON STOOD WHILEOGILVY EXCLAIMED AT THE STREAMER OF GAS THAT CAME OUT TOWARDS USTHAT NIGHT ANOTHER INVISIBLE MISSILE STARTED ON ITS WAY TO THEEARTH FROM MARS JUST A SECOND OR SO UNDER TWENTYFOUR HOURS AFTER THEFIRST ONE  I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESSWITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES  I WISHED IHAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY LITTLE SUSPECTING THE MEANING OF THE MINUTEGLEAM I HAD SEEN AND ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME  OGILVYWATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE IT UP AND WE LIT THE LANTERN ANDWALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE  DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE OTTERSHAWAND CHERTSEY AND ALL THEIR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACEHE WAS FULL OF SPECULATION THAT NIGHT ABOUT THE CONDITION OF MARSAND SCOFFED AT THE VULGAR IDEA OF ITS HAVING INHABITANTS WHO WERESIGNALLING US  HIS IDEA WAS THAT METEORITES MIGHT BE FALLING IN AHEAVY SHOWER UPON THE PLANET OR THAT A HUGE VOLCANIC EXPLOSION WAS INPROGRESS  HE POINTED OUT TO ME HOW UNLIKELY IT WAS THAT ORGANICEVOLUTION HAD TAKEN THE SAME DIRECTION IN THE TWO ADJACENT PLANETSTHE CHANCES AGAINST ANYTHING MANLIKE ON MARS ARE A MILLION TOONE HE SAIDHUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTERABOUT MIDNIGHT AND AGAIN THE NIGHT AFTER AND SO FOR TEN NIGHTS AFLAME EACH NIGHT  WHY THE SHOTS CEASED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ONEARTH HAS ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN  IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRINGCAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE  DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUSTVISIBLE THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE ON EARTH AS LITTLE GREYFLUCTUATING PATCHES SPREAD THROUGH THE CLEARNESS OF THE PLANETSATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURESEVEN THE DAILY PAPERS WOKE UP TO THE DISTURBANCES AT LAST ANDPOPULAR NOTES APPEARED HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE CONCERNING THEVOLCANOES UPON MARS  THE SERIOCOMIC PERIODICAL PUNCH I REMEMBERMADE A HAPPY USE OF IT IN THE POLITICAL CARTOON  AND ALLUNSUSPECTED THOSE MISSILES THE MARTIANS HAD FIRED AT US DREWEARTHWARD RUSHING NOW AT A PACE OF MANY MILES A SECOND THROUGH THEEMPTY GULF OF SPACE HOUR BY HOUR AND DAY BY DAY NEARER AND NEARERIT SEEMS TO ME NOW ALMOST INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL THAT WITH THAT SWIFTFATE HANGING OVER US MEN COULD GO ABOUT THEIR PETTY CONCERNS AS THEYDID  I REMEMBER HOW JUBILANT MARKHAM WAS AT SECURING A NEW PHOTOGRAPHOF THE PLANET FOR THE ILLUSTRATED PAPER HE EDITED IN THOSE DAYSPEOPLE IN THESE LATTER TIMES SCARCELY REALISE THE ABUNDANCE ANDENTERPRISE OF OUR NINETEENTHCENTURY PAPERS  FOR MY OWN PART I WASMUCH OCCUPIED IN LEARNING TO RIDE THE BICYCLE AND BUSY UPON A SERIESOF PAPERS DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE DEVELOPMENTS OF MORAL IDEAS ASCIVILISATION PROGRESSEDONE NIGHT THE FIRST MISSILE THEN COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN MILES AWAY I WENT FOR A WALK WITH MY WIFE  IT WASSTARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER AND POINTEDOUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT CREEPING ZENITHWARD TOWARDS WHICH SOMANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED  IT WAS A WARM NIGHT  COMING HOME APARTY OF EXCURSIONISTS FROM CHERTSEY OR ISLEWORTH PASSED US SINGINGAND PLAYING MUSIC  THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THEHOUSES AS THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED  FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THEDISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF SHUNTING TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLINGSOFTENED ALMOST INTO MELODY BY THE DISTANCE  MY WIFE POINTED OUT TOME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS HANGINGIN A FRAMEWORK AGAINST THE SKY  IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUILCHAPTER TWOTHE FALLING STARTHEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR  IT WAS SEEN EARLYIN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER WINCHESTER EASTWARD A LINE OF FLAME HIGHIN THE ATMOSPHERE  HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR ANORDINARY FALLING STAR  ALBIN DESCRIBED IT AS LEAVING A GREENISHSTREAK BEHIND IT THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS  DENNING OUR GREATESTAUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRSTAPPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES  IT SEEMED TO HIMTHAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HIMI WAS AT HOME AT THAT HOUR AND WRITING IN MY STUDY AND ALTHOUGH MYFRENCH WINDOWS FACE TOWARDS OTTERSHAW AND THE BLIND WAS UP FOR ILOVED IN THOSE DAYS TO LOOK UP AT THE NIGHT SKY I SAW NOTHING OF ITYET THIS STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTERSPACE MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING THERE VISIBLE TO ME HAD IONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED  SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY ITTRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND  I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT  MANYPEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN THE FALL OFIT AND AT MOST HAVE THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDEDNO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE TROUBLED TO LOOK FOR THE FALLEN MASS THAT NIGHTBUT VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING POOR OGILVY WHO HAD SEEN THESHOOTING STAR AND WHO WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE ONTHE COMMON BETWEEN HORSELL OTTERSHAW AND WOKING ROSE EARLY WITH THEIDEA OF FINDING IT  FIND IT HE DID SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROMTHE SAND PITS  AN ENORMOUS HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THEPROJECTILE AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERYDIRECTION OVER THE HEATH FORMING HEAPS VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALFAWAY  THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE EASTWARD AND A THIN BLUE SMOKE ROSEAGAINST THE DAWNTHE THING ITSELF LAY ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND AMIDST THESCATTERED SPLINTERS OF A FIR TREE IT HAD SHIVERED TO FRAGMENTS IN ITSDESCENT  THE UNCOVERED PART HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HUGE CYLINDERCAKED OVER AND ITS OUTLINE SOFTENED BY A THICK SCALY DUNCOLOUREDINCRUSTATION  IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS  HE APPROACHEDTHE MASS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND MORE SO AT THE SHAPE SINCE MOSTMETEORITES ARE ROUNDED MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY  IT WAS HOWEVERSTILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR AS TO FORBID HIS NEARAPPROACH  A STIRRING NOISE WITHIN ITS CYLINDER HE ASCRIBED TO THEUNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURREDTO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOWHE REMAINED STANDING AT THE EDGE OF THE PIT THAT THE THING HAD MADEFOR ITSELF STARING AT ITS STRANGE APPEARANCE ASTONISHED CHIEFLY ATITS UNUSUAL SHAPE AND COLOUR AND DIMLY PERCEIVING EVEN THEN SOMEEVIDENCE OF DESIGN IN ITS ARRIVAL  THE EARLY MORNING WAS WONDERFULLYSTILL AND THE SUN JUST CLEARING THE PINE TREES TOWARDS WEYBRIDGEWAS ALREADY WARM  HE DID NOT REMEMBER HEARING ANY BIRDS THAT MORNINGTHERE WAS CERTAINLY NO BREEZE STIRRING AND THE ONLY SOUNDS WERE THEFAINT MOVEMENTS FROM WITHIN THE CINDERY CYLINDER  HE WAS ALL ALONE ONTHE COMMONTHEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED WITH A START THAT SOME OF THE GREYCLINKER THE ASHY INCRUSTATION THAT COVERED THE METEORITE WAS FALLINGOFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE OF THE END  IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES ANDRAINING DOWN UPON THE SAND  A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELLWITH A SHARP NOISE THAT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTHFOR A MINUTE HE SCARCELY REALISED WHAT THIS MEANT AND ALTHOUGHTHE HEAT WAS EXCESSIVE HE CLAMBERED DOWN INTO THE PIT CLOSE TO THEBULK TO SEE THE THING MORE CLEARLY  HE FANCIED EVEN THEN THAT THECOOLING OF THE BODY MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THIS BUT WHAT DISTURBED THATIDEA WAS THE FACT THAT THE ASH WAS FALLING ONLY FROM THE END OF THECYLINDERAND THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT VERY SLOWLY THE CIRCULAR TOP OF THECYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY  IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENTTHAT HE DISCOVERED IT ONLY THROUGH NOTICING THAT A BLACK MARK THAT HADBEEN NEAR HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THECIRCUMFERENCE  EVEN THEN HE SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS INDICATEDUNTIL HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERKFORWARD AN INCH OR SO  THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH  THECYLINDER WAS ARTIFICIALHOLLOWWITH AN END THAT SCREWED OUTSOMETHING WITHIN THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOPGOOD HEAVENS SAID OGILVY  THERES A MAN IN ITMEN IN IT HALFROASTED TO DEATH  TRYING TO ESCAPEAT ONCE WITH A QUICK MENTAL LEAP HE LINKED THE THING WITH THEFLASH UPON MARSTHE THOUGHT OF THE CONFINED CREATURE WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HEFORGOT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD TO THE CYLINDER TO HELP TURN  BUTLUCKILY THE DULL RADIATION ARRESTED HIM BEFORE HE COULD BURN HIS HANDSON THE STILLGLOWING METAL  AT THAT HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENTTHEN TURNED SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT AND SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTOWOKING  THE TIME THEN MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ABOUT SIX OCLOCKHE MET A WAGGONER AND TRIED TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND BUT THE TALE HETOLD AND HIS APPEARANCE WERE SO WILDHIS HAT HAD FALLEN OFF IN THEPITTHAT THE MAN SIMPLY DROVE ON  HE WAS EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL WITH THEPOTMAN WHO WAS JUST UNLOCKING THE DOORS OF THE PUBLICHOUSE BY HORSELLBRIDGE  THE FELLOW THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE ANUNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO SHUT HIM INTO THE TAPROOM  THAT SOBERED HIM ALITTLE AND WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON THE LONDON JOURNALIST IN HISGARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE PALINGS AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOODHENDERSON HE CALLED YOU SAW THAT SHOOTING STAR LAST NIGHTWELL SAID HENDERSONITS OUT ON HORSELL COMMON NOWGOOD LORD SAID HENDERSON  FALLEN METEORITE  THATS GOODBUT ITS SOMETHING MORE THAN A METEORITE  ITS A CYLINDERANARTIFICIAL CYLINDER MAN  AND THERES SOMETHING INSIDEHENDERSON STOOD UP WITH HIS SPADE IN HIS HANDWHATS THAT HE SAID  HE WAS DEAF IN ONE EAROGILVY TOLD HIM ALL THAT HE HAD SEEN  HENDERSON WAS A MINUTE OR SOTAKING IT IN  THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE SNATCHED UP HIS JACKET ANDCAME OUT INTO THE ROAD  THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AT ONCE TO THECOMMON AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION  BUTNOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD CEASED AND A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METALSHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER  AIR WAS EITHERENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUNDTHEY LISTENED RAPPED ON THE SCALY BURNT METAL WITH A STICK ANDMEETING WITH NO RESPONSE THEY BOTH CONCLUDED THE MAN OR MEN INSIDEMUST BE INSENSIBLE OR DEADOF COURSE THE TWO WERE QUITE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING  THEY SHOUTEDCONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GETHELP  ONE CAN IMAGINE THEM COVERED WITH SAND EXCITED ANDDISORDERED RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT JUSTAS THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WEREOPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS  HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAYSTATION AT ONCE IN ORDER TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON  THENEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED MENS MINDS FOR THE RECEPTION OF THEIDEABY EIGHT OCLOCK A NUMBER OF BOYS AND UNEMPLOYED MEN HAD ALREADYSTARTED FOR THE COMMON TO SEE THE DEAD MEN FROM MARS  THAT WAS THEFORM THE STORY TOOK  I HEARD OF IT FIRST FROM MY NEWSPAPER BOY ABOUTA QUARTER TO NINE WHEN I WENT OUT TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE  I WASNATURALLY STARTLED AND LOST NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND ACROSS THEOTTERSHAW BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITSCHAPTER THREEON HORSELL COMMONI FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF PERHAPS TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THEHUGE HOLE IN WHICH THE CYLINDER LAY  I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THEAPPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND  THE TURFAND GRAVEL ABOUT IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION  NODOUBT ITS IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE  HENDERSON AND OGILVYWERE NOT THERE  I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONEFOR THE PRESENT AND HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSONS HOUSETHERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE BOYS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT WITHTHEIR FEET DANGLING AND AMUSING THEMSELVESUNTIL I STOPPED THEMBYTHROWING STONES AT THE GIANT MASS  AFTER I HAD SPOKEN TO THEM ABOUTIT THEY BEGAN PLAYING AT TOUCH IN AND OUT OF THE GROUP OFBYSTANDERSAMONG THESE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A JOBBING GARDENER IEMPLOYED SOMETIMES A GIRL CARRYING A BABY GREGG THE BUTCHER AND HISLITTLE BOY AND TWO OR THREE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WHO WEREACCUSTOMED TO HANG ABOUT THE RAILWAY STATION  THERE WAS VERY LITTLETALKING  FEW OF THE COMMON PEOPLE IN ENGLAND HAD ANYTHING BUT THEVAGUEST ASTRONOMICAL IDEAS IN THOSE DAYS  MOST OF THEM WERE STARINGQUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE LIKE END OF THE CYLINDER WHICH WAS STILL ASOGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT  I FANCY THE POPULAR EXPECTATION OFA HEAP OF CHARRED CORPSES WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULKSOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME  I CLAMBEREDINTO THE PIT AND FANCIED I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET  THETOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATEIT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THUS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OFTHIS OBJECT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME  AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WASREALLY NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWNACROSS THE ROAD  NOT SO MUCH SO INDEED  IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASFLOAT  IT REQUIRED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION TOPERCEIVE THAT THE GREY SCALE OF THE THING WAS NO COMMON OXIDE THATTHE YELLOWISHWHITE METAL THAT GLEAMED IN THE CRACK BETWEEN THE LIDAND THE CYLINDER HAD AN UNFAMILIAR HUE  EXTRATERRESTRIAL HAD NOMEANING FOR MOST OF THE ONLOOKERSAT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HADCOME FROM THE PLANET MARS BUT I JUDGED IT IMPROBABLE THAT ITCONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE  I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BEAUTOMATIC  IN SPITE OF OGILVY I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MENIN MARS  MY MIND RAN FANCIFULLY ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITSCONTAINING MANUSCRIPT ON THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHTARISE WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO FORTHYET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE ON THIS IDEA  I FELT ANIMPATIENCE TO SEE IT OPENED  ABOUT ELEVEN AS NOTHING SEEMEDHAPPENING I WALKED BACK FULL OF SUCH THOUGHT TO MY HOME IN MAYBURYBUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK UPON MY ABSTRACTINVESTIGATIONSIN THE AFTERNOON THE APPEARANCE OF THE COMMON HAD ALTERED VERYMUCH  THE EARLY EDITIONS OF THE EVENING PAPERS HAD STARTLED LONDONWITH ENORMOUS HEADLINES  A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS  REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKINGAND SO FORTH  IN ADDITION OGILVYS WIRE TO THE ASTRONOMICAL EXCHANGEHAD ROUSED EVERY OBSERVATORY IN THE THREE KINGDOMSTHERE WERE HALF A DOZEN FLIES OR MORE FROM THE WOKING STATIONSTANDING IN THE ROAD BY THE SAND PITS A BASKETCHAISE FROM CHOBHAMAND A RATHER LORDLY CARRIAGE  BESIDES THAT THERE WAS QUITE A HEAP OFBICYCLES  IN ADDITION A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MUST HAVE WALKED INSPITE OF THE HEAT OF THE DAY FROM WOKING AND CHERTSEY SO THAT THEREWAS ALTOGETHER QUITE A CONSIDERABLE CROWDONE OR TWO GAILY DRESSEDLADIES AMONG THE OTHERSIT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WINDAND THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES  THEBURNING HEATHER HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED BUT THE LEVEL GROUND TOWARDSOTTERSHAW WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND STILL GIVING OFFVERTICAL STREAMERS OF SMOKE  AN ENTERPRISING SWEETSTUFF DEALER INTHE CHOBHAM ROAD HAD SENT UP HIS SON WITH A BARROWLOAD OF GREENAPPLES AND GINGER BEERGOING TO THE EDGE OF THE PIT I FOUND IT OCCUPIED BY A GROUP OFABOUT HALF A DOZEN MENHENDERSON OGILVY AND A TALL FAIRHAIRED MANTHAT I AFTERWARDS LEARNED WAS STENT THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL WITHSEVERAL WORKMEN WIELDING SPADES AND PICKAXES  STENT WAS GIVINGDIRECTIONS IN A CLEAR HIGHPITCHED VOICE  HE WAS STANDING ON THECYLINDER WHICH WAS NOW EVIDENTLY MUCH COOLER HIS FACE WAS CRIMSONAND STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION AND SOMETHING SEEMED TO HAVEIRRITATED HIMA LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED THOUGH ITSLOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED  AS SOON AS OGILVY SAW ME AMONG THESTARING CROWD ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN ANDASKED ME IF I WOULD MIND GOING OVER TO SEE LORD HILTON THE LORD OFTHE MANORTHE GROWING CROWD HE SAID WAS BECOMING A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TOTHEIR EXCAVATIONS ESPECIALLY THE BOYS  THEY WANTED A LIGHT RAILINGPUT UP AND HELP TO KEEP THE PEOPLE BACK  HE TOLD ME THAT A FAINTSTIRRING WAS OCCASIONALLY STILL AUDIBLE WITHIN THE CASE BUT THAT THEWORKMEN HAD FAILED TO UNSCREW THE TOP AS IT AFFORDED NO GRIP TO THEMTHE CASE APPEARED TO BE ENORMOUSLY THICK AND IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THEFAINT SOUNDS WE HEARD REPRESENTED A NOISY TUMULT IN THE INTERIORI WAS VERY GLAD TO DO AS HE ASKED AND SO BECOME ONE OF THEPRIVILEGED SPECTATORS WITHIN THE CONTEMPLATED ENCLOSURE  I FAILED TOFIND LORD HILTON AT HIS HOUSE BUT I WAS TOLD HE WAS EXPECTED FROMLONDON BY THE SIX OCLOCK TRAIN FROM WATERLOO AND AS IT WAS THENABOUT A QUARTER PAST FIVE I WENT HOME HAD SOME TEA AND WALKED UP TOTHE STATION TO WAYLAY HIMCHAPTER FOURTHE CYLINDER OPENSWHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING  SCATTERED GROUPSWERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING AND ONE OR TWO PERSONSWERE RETURNING  THE CROWD ABOUT THE PIT HAD INCREASED AND STOOD OUTBLACK AGAINST THE LEMON YELLOW OF THE SKYA COUPLE OF HUNDRED PEOPLEPERHAPS  THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEAREDTO BE GOING ON ABOUT THE PIT  STRANGE IMAGININGS PASSED THROUGH MYMIND  AS I DREW NEARER I HEARD STENTS VOICEKEEP BACK  KEEP BACKA BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS MEITS AMOVIN HE SAID TO ME AS HE PASSED ASCREWIN ANDASCREWIN OUT  I DONT LIKE IT  IM AGOIN OME I AMI WENT ON TO THE CROWD  THERE WERE REALLY I SHOULD THINK TWO ORTHREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING AND JOSTLING ONE ANOTHER THE ONE OR TWOLADIES THERE BEING BY NO MEANS THE LEAST ACTIVEHES FALLEN IN THE PIT

THESE IDIOTS BACK  WE DONT KNOWWHATS IN THE CONFOUNDED THING YOU KNOWI SAW A YOUNG MAN A SHOP ASSISTANT IN WOKING I BELIEVE HE WASSTANDING ON THE CYLINDER AND TRYING TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE HOLE AGAINTHE CROWD HAD PUSHED HIM INTHE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS BEING SCREWED OUT FROM WITHIN  NEARLYTWO FEET OF SHINING SCREW PROJECTED  SOMEBODY BLUNDERED AGAINST MEAND I NARROWLY MISSED BEING PITCHED ONTO THE TOP OF THE SCREW  ITURNED AND AS I DID SO THE SCREW MUST HAVE COME OUT FOR THE LID OFTHE CYLINDER FELL UPON THE GRAVEL WITH A RINGING CONCUSSION  I STUCKMY ELBOW INTO THE PERSON BEHIND ME AND TURNED MY HEAD TOWARDS THETHING AGAIN  FOR A MOMENT THAT CIRCULAR CAVITY SEEMED PERFECTLY BLACKI HAD THE SUNSET IN MY EYESI THINK EVERYONE EXPECTED TO SEE A MAN EMERGEPOSSIBLY SOMETHING ALITTLE UNLIKE US TERRESTRIAL MEN BUT IN ALL ESSENTIALS A MAN  I KNOWI DID  BUT LOOKING I PRESENTLY SAW SOMETHING STIRRING WITHIN THESHADOW GREYISH BILLOWY MOVEMENTS ONE ABOVE ANOTHER AND THEN TWOLUMINOUS DISKSLIKE EYES  THEN SOMETHING RESEMBLING A LITTLE GREYSNAKE ABOUT THE THICKNESS OF A WALKING STICK COILED UP OUT OF THEWRITHING MIDDLE AND WRIGGLED IN THE AIR TOWARDS MEAND THEN ANOTHERA SUDDEN CHILL CAME OVER ME  THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMANBEHIND  I HALF TURNED KEEPING MY EYES FIXED UPON THE CYLINDER STILLFROM WHICH OTHER TENTACLES WERE NOW PROJECTING AND BEGAN PUSHING MYWAY BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE PIT  I SAW ASTONISHMENT GIVING PLACE TOHORROR ON THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT ME  I HEARD INARTICULATEEXCLAMATIONS ON ALL SIDES  THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT BACKWARDSI SAW THE SHOPMAN STRUGGLING STILL ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT  I FOUNDMYSELF ALONE AND SAW THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PIT RUNNINGOFF STENT AMONG THEM  I LOOKED AGAIN AT THE CYLINDER ANDUNGOVERNABLE TERROR GRIPPED ME  I STOOD PETRIFIED AND STARINGA BIG GREYISH ROUNDED BULK THE SIZE PERHAPS OF A BEAR WASRISING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY OUT OF THE CYLINDER  AS IT BULGED UP ANDCAUGHT THE LIGHT IT GLISTENED LIKE WET LEATHERTWO LARGE DARKCOLOURED EYES WERE REGARDING ME STEADFASTLY  THEMASS THAT FRAMED THEM THE HEAD OF THE THING WAS ROUNDED AND HADONE MIGHT SAY A FACE  THERE WAS A MOUTH UNDER THE EYES THE LIPLESSBRIM OF WHICH

VANISHED  IT HAD TOPPLED OVER THE BRIM OF THECYLINDER AND FALLEN INTO THE PIT WITH A THUD LIKE THE FALL OF A GREATMASS OF LEATHER  I HEARD IT GIVE A PECULIAR THICK CRY AND FORTHWITHANOTHER OF THESE CREATURES APPEARED DARKLY IN THE DEEP SHADOW OF THEAPERTUREI TURNED AND RUNNING MADLY MADE FOR THE FIRST GROUP OF TREESPERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY BUT I RAN SLANTINGLY AND STUMBLING FORI COULD NOT

MINGLED THEREWITH MASSES OF BLACK AND RED SMOKERIPLEY STREET WAS DESERTED AND EXCEPT FOR A LIGHTED WINDOW OR SOTHE VILLAGE SHOWED NOT A SIGN OF LIFE BUT I NARROWLY ESCAPED ANACCIDENT AT THE CORNER OF THE ROAD TO PYRFORD WHERE A KNOT OF PEOPLESTOOD WITH THEIR BACKS TO ME  THEY SAID NOTHING TO ME AS I PASSED  IDO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY KNEW OF THE THINGS HAPPENING BEYOND THE HILLNOR DO I KNOW IF THE SILENT HOUSES I PASSED ON MY WAY WERE SLEEPINGSECURELY OR DESERTED AND EMPTY OR HARASSED AND WATCHING AGAINST THETERROR OF THE NIGHTFROM RIPLEY UNTIL I CAME THROUGH PYRFORD I WAS IN THE VALLEY OF THEWEY AND THE RED GLARE WAS HIDDEN FROM ME  AS I ASCENDED THE LITTLEHILL BEYOND PYRFORD CHURCH THE GLARE CAME INTO VIEW AGAIN AND THETREES ABOUT ME SHIVERED WITH THE FIRST INTIMATION OF THE STORM THATWAS UPON ME  THEN I HEARD MIDNIGHT PEALING OUT FROM PYRFORD CHURCHBEHIND ME AND THEN CAME THE SILHOUETTE OF MAYBURY HILL WITH ITSTREETOPS AND ROOFS BLACK AND SHARP AGAINST THE REDEVEN AS I BEHELD THIS A LURID GREEN GLARE LIT THE ROAD ABOUT ME ANDSHOWED THE DISTANT WOODS TOWARDS ADDLESTONE  I FELT A TUG AT THEREINS  I SAW THAT THE DRIVING CLOUDS HAD BEEN PIERCED AS IT WERE BY ATHREAD OF GREEN

WET ROOF OF A HOUSE BUT ONE FLASH FOLLOWING ANOTHER SHOWED ITTO BE IN SWIFT ROLLING MOVEMENT  IT WAS AN ELUSIVE VISIONA MOMENTOF BEWILDERING DARKNESS AND THEN IN A FLASH LIKE DAYLIGHT THE REDMASSES OF THE ORPHANAGE NEAR THE CREST OF THE HILL THE GREEN TOPS OFTHE PINE TREES AND THIS PROBLEMATICAL OBJECT CAME OUT CLEAR AND SHARPAND BRIGHTAND THIS THING I SAW  HOW CAN I DESCRIBE IT  A MONSTROUS TRIPODHIGHER THAN MANY HOUSES STRIDING OVER THE YOUNG PINE TREES ANDSMASHING THEM ASIDE IN ITS CAREER A WALKING ENGINE OF GLITTERINGMETAL STRIDING NOW ACROSS THE HEATHER ARTICULATE ROPES OF

HIS NECKWAS BROKEN POOR BRUTE AND BY THE LIGHTNING FLASHES I SAW THE BLACKBULK OF THE OVERTURNED DOG CART AND THE SILHOUETTE OF THE WHEEL STILLSPINNING SLOWLY  IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE COLOSSAL MECHANISM WENTSTRIDING BY ME AND PASSED UPHILL TOWARDS PYRFORDSEEN NEARER THE THING WAS INCREDIBLY STRANGE FOR IT WAS NO MEREINSENSATE MACHINE DRIVING ON ITS WAY  MACHINE IT WAS WITH A RINGINGMETALLIC PACE AND LONG FLEXIBLE GLITTERING TENTACLES ONE OF WHICHGRIPPED A YOUNG PINE TREE SWINGING AND RATTLING ABOUT ITS STRANGEBODY  IT PICKED ITS ROAD AS IT WENT STRIDING ALONG AND THE BRAZENHOOD THAT SURMOUNTED IT MOVED TO AND FRO WITH THE INEVITABLESUGGESTION OF A HEAD LOOKING ABOUT  BEHIND THE MAIN BODY WAS A HUGEMASS OF WHITE METAL LIKE A GIGANTIC FISHERMANS BASKET AND PUFFS OFGREEN SMOKE SQUIRTED OUT FROM THE JOINTS OF THE LIMBS AS THE MONSTERSWEPT BY ME  AND IN AN INSTANT IT WAS GONESO MUCH I SAW THEN ALL VAGUELY FOR THE FLICKERING OF THELIGHTNING IN BLINDING HIGHLIGHTS AND DENSE BLACK SHADOWSAS IT

THING IN THE FIELD WAS THE THIRD OF THE TENCYLINDERS THEY HAD FIRED AT US FROM MARSFOR SOME MINUTES I LAY THERE IN THE RAIN AND DARKNESS WATCHING BYTHE INTERMITTENT LIGHT THESE MONSTROUS BEINGS OF METAL MOVING ABOUTIN THE DISTANCE OVER THE HEDGE TOPS  A THIN HAIL WAS NOW BEGINNINGAND AS IT CAME AND WENT THEIR FIGURES GREW MISTY AND THEN FLASHED INTOCLEARNESS AGAIN  NOW AND THEN CAME A GAP IN THE LIGHTNING AND THENIGHT SWALLOWED THEM UPI WAS SOAKED WITH HAIL ABOVE AND PUDDLE WATER BELOW  IT WAS SOMETIME BEFORE MY BLANK ASTONISHMENT WOULD LET ME STRUGGLE UP THE BANK TOA DRIER POSITION OR THINK AT ALL OF MY IMMINENT PERILNOT FAR FROM ME WAS A LITTLE ONEROOMED SQUATTERS HUT OF WOODSURROUNDED BY A PATCH OF POTATO GARDEN  I STRUGGLED TO MY FEET ATLAST AND CROUCHING AND MAKING USE OF EVERY CHANCE OF COVER I MADE ARUN FOR THIS  I HAMMERED AT THE DOOR BUT I COULD NOT MAKE THE PEOPLEHEAR IF THERE WERE ANY PEOPLE INSIDE AND AFTER A TIME I DESISTEDAND AVAILING MYSELF OF A DITCH FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE WAYSUCCEEDED IN CRAWLING UNOBSERVED BY THESE MONSTROUS MACHINES INTOTHE PINE WOODS TOWARDS MAYBURYUNDER COVER OF THIS I PUSHED ON WET AND SHIVERING NOW TOWARDS MYOWN HOUSE  I WALKED AMONG THE TREES TRYING TO FIND THE FOOTPATH  ITWAS VERY DARK INDEED IN THE WOOD FOR THE LIGHTNING WAS NOW BECOMINGINFREQUENT AND THE HAIL WHICH WAS POURING DOWN IN A TORRENT FELL INCOLUMNS THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE HEAVY FOLIAGEIF I HAD FULLY REALISED THE MEANING OF ALL THE THINGS I HAD SEEN ISHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY WORKED MY WAY ROUND THROUGH BYFLEET TO STREETCOBHAM AND SO GONE BACK TO REJOIN MY WIFE AT LEATHERHEAD  BUT THATNIGHT THE STRANGENESS OF THINGS ABOUT ME AND MY PHYSICALWRETCHEDNESS PREVENTED ME FOR I WAS BRUISED WEARY WET TO THE SKINDEAFENED AND BLINDED BY THE STORMI HAD A VAGUE IDEA OF GOING ON TO MY OWN HOUSE AND THAT WAS ASMUCH MOTIVE AS I HAD  I STAGGERED THROUGH THE TREES FELL INTO ADITCH AND BRUISED MY KNEES AGAINST A PLANK AND FINALLY SPLASHED OUTINTO THE LANE THAT RAN DOWN FROM THE COLLEGE ARMS  I SAY SPLASHEDFOR THE STORM WATER WAS SWEEPING THE SAND DOWN THE HILL IN A MUDDYTORRENT  THERE IN THE DARKNESS A MAN BLUNDERED INTO ME AND SENT MEREELING BACKHE GAVE A CRY OF TERROR SPRANG SIDEWAYS AND RUSHED ON BEFORE ICOULD GATHER MY WITS SUFFICIENTLY TO SPEAK TO HIM  SO HEAVY WAS THESTRESS OF THE STORM JUST AT THIS PLACE THAT I HAD THE HARDEST TASK TOWIN MY WAY UP THE HILL  I WENT CLOSE UP TO THE FENCE ON THE LEFT ANDWORKED MY WAY ALONG ITS PALINGSNEAR THE TOP I STUMBLED UPON SOMETHING SOFT AND BY A FLASH OFLIGHTNING SAW BETWEEN MY FEET A HEAP OF BLACK BROADCLOTH AND A PAIROF BOOTS  BEFORE I COULD DISTINGUISH CLEARLY HOW THE MAN LAY THEFLICKER OF LIGHT HAD PASSED  I STOOD OVER HIM WAITING FOR THE NEXTFLASH  WHEN IT CAME I SAW THAT HE WAS A STURDY MAN CHEAPLY BUT NOTSHABBILY DRESSED HIS HEAD WAS BENT UNDER HIS BODY AND HE LAYCRUMPLED UP CLOSE TO THE FENCE AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLYAGAINST ITOVERCOMING THE REPUGNANCE NATURAL TO ONE WHO HAD NEVER BEFORETOUCHED A DEAD BODY I STOOPED AND TURNED HIM OVER TO FEEL FOR HISHEART  HE WAS QUITE DEAD  APPARENTLY HIS NECK HAD BEEN BROKEN  THELIGHTNING FLASHED FOR A THIRD TIME AND HIS FACE LEAPED UPON ME  ISPRANG TO MY FEET  IT WAS THE LANDLORD OF THE SPOTTED DOG WHOSECONVEYANCE I HAD TAKENI STEPPED OVER HIM GINGERLY AND PUSHED ON UP THE HILL  I MADE MYWAY BY THE POLICE STATION AND THE COLLEGE ARMS TOWARDS MY OWN HOUSENOTHING WAS BURNING ON THE HILLSIDE THOUGH FROM THE COMMON THERESTILL CAME A RED GLARE AND A ROLLING TUMULT OF RUDDY SMOKE BEATING UPAGAINST THE DRENCHING HAIL  SO FAR AS I COULD SEE BY THE FLASHES THEHOUSES ABOUT ME WERE MOSTLY UNINJURED  BY THE COLLEGE ARMS A DARKHEAP LAY IN THE ROADDOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS MAYBURY BRIDGE THERE WERE VOICES AND THESOUND OF FEET BUT I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO SHOUT OR TO GO TO THEM  ILET MYSELF IN WITH MY LATCHKEY CLOSED LOCKED AND BOLTED THE DOORSTAGGERED TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND SAT DOWN  MY IMAGINATIONWAS FULL OF THOSE STRIDING METALLIC MONSTERS AND OF THE DEAD BODYSMASHED AGAINST THE FENCEI CROUCHED AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE WITH MY BACK TO THE WALLSHIVERING VIOLENTLYCHAPTER ELEVENAT THE WINDOWI HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT MY STORMS OF EMOTION HAVE A TRICK OFEXHAUSTING THEMSELVES  AFTER A TIME I DISCOVERED THAT I WAS COLD ANDWET AND WITH LITTLE POOLS OF WATER ABOUT ME ON THE STAIR CARPET  IGOT UP

GUNS  BUT THE EARTHLY ARTILLERY MADE NO REPLYNOW AT THE TIME WE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS BUT LATER IWAS TO LEARN THE MEANING OF THESE OMINOUS KOPJES THAT GATHERED IN THETWILIGHT  EACH OF THE MARTIANS STANDING IN THE GREAT CRESCENT I HAVEDESCRIBED HAD DISCHARGED BY MEANS OF THE GUNLIKE TUBE HE CARRIED AHUGE CANISTER OVER WHATEVER HILL COPSE CLUSTER OF HOUSES OR OTHERPOSSIBLE COVER FOR GUNS

SANK AND SPREAD ITSELF SLOWLY OVER THESURROUNDING COUNTRY  AND THE TOUCH OF THAT VAPOUR THE INHALING OFITS PUNGENT WISPS WAS DEATH TO ALL THAT BREATHESIT WAS HEAVY THIS VAPOUR HEAVIER THAN THE DENSEST SMOKE SO THATAFTER THE FIRST TUMULTUOUS UPRUSH AND OUTFLOW OF ITS IMPACT IT SANKDOWN THROUGH THE AIR AND POURED OVER THE GROUND IN A MANNER RATHERLIQUID THAN GASEOUS ABANDONING THE HILLS AND STREAMING

THESURFACE WOULD BE INSTANTLY COVERED WITH A POWDERY SCUM THAT SANKSLOWLY AND MADE WAY FOR MORE  THE SCUM WAS ABSOLUTELY INSOLUBLE ANDIT IS A STRANGE THING SEEING THE INSTANT EFFECT OF THE GAS THAT ONECOULD DRINK WITHOUT HURT THE WATER FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN STRAINEDTHE VAPOUR DID NOT DIFFUSE AS A TRUE GAS WOULD DO  IT HUNG TOGETHERIN BANKS FLOWING SLUGGISHLY DOWN THE SLOPE OF THE LAND AND

THAT NIGHT AT STREET COBHAM AND DITTONTHE MAN WHO ESCAPED AT THE FORMER PLACE TELLS A WONDERFUL STORY OFTHE STRANGENESS OF ITS COILING FLOW AND HOW HE LOOKED DOWN FROM THECHURCH SPIRE AND SAW THE

ACROSS THE FLOORAGAINST THE OVEN HANDLE AND STUNNED  I WAS INSENSIBLE FOR A LONGTIME THE CURATE TOLD ME AND WHEN I CAME TO WE WERE IN DARKNESSAGAIN AND HE WITH A FACE WET AS I FOUND AFTERWARDS WITH BLOOD FROMA CUT FOREHEAD WAS DABBING WATER OVER MEFOR SOME TIME I COULD NOT RECOLLECT WHAT HAD HAPPENED  THEN THINGSCAME TO ME SLOWLY  A BRUISE ON MY TEMPLE ASSERTED ITSELFARE YOU BETTER ASKED THE CURATE IN A WHISPERAT LAST I ANSWERED HIM  I SAT UPDONT MOVE HE SAID  THE FLOOR IS COVERED WITH SMASHED CROCKERYFROM THE DRESSER  YOU CANT POSSIBLY MOVE WITHOUT MAKING A NOISE ANDI FANCY THEY ARE OUTSIDEWE BOTH SAT QUITE SILENT SO THAT WE COULD SCARCELY HEAR EACH OTHERBREATHING  EVERYTHING SEEMED DEADLY STILL BUT ONCE SOMETHING NEARUS SOME PLASTER OR BROKEN BRICKWORK SLID DOWN WITH A RUMBLING SOUNDOUTSIDE AND VERY NEAR WAS AN INTERMITTENT METALLIC RATTLETHAT SAID THE CURATE WHEN PRESENTLY IT HAPPENED AGAINYES I SAID  BUT WHAT IS ITA MARTIAN SAID THE CURATEI LISTENED AGAINIT WAS NOT LIKE THE HEATRAY I SAID AND FOR A TIME I WASINCLINED TO THINK ONE OF THE GREAT FIGHTINGMACHINES HAD STUMBLEDAGAINST THE HOUSE AS I HAD SEEN ONE STUMBLE AGAINST THE TOWER OFSHEPPERTON CHURCHOUR SITUATION WAS SO STRANGE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT FOR THREE ORFOUR HOURS UNTIL THE DAWN CAME WE SCARCELY MOVED  AND THEN THE LIGHTFILTERED IN NOT THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH REMAINED BLACK BUT THROUGHA TRIANGULAR APERTURE BETWEEN A BEAM AND A HEAP OF BROKEN BRICKS INTHE WALL BEHIND US  THE INTERIOR OF THE KITCHEN WE NOW SAW GREYLY FORTHE FIRST TIMETHE WINDOW HAD BEEN BURST IN BY A MASS OF GARDEN MOULD WHICHFLOWED OVER THE TABLE UPON WHICH WE HAD BEEN SITTING AND LAY ABOUT OURFEET  OUTSIDE THE SOIL WAS BANKED HIGH AGAINST THE HOUSE  AT THETOP OF THE WINDOW FRAME WE COULD SEE AN UPROOTED DRAINPIPE  THE FLOORWAS LITTERED WITH SMASHED HARDWARE THE END OF THE KITCHEN TOWARDS THEHOUSE WAS BROKEN INTO AND SINCE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE IN THERE IT WASEVIDENT THE GREATER PART OF THE HOUSE HAD COLLAPSED  CONTRASTINGVIVIDLY WITH THIS RUIN WAS THE NEAT DRESSER STAINED IN THE FASHIONPALE GREEN AND WITH A NUMBER OF COPPER AND TIN VESSELS BELOW IT THEWALLPAPER IMITATING BLUE AND WHITE TILES AND A COUPLE OF COLOUREDSUPPLEMENTS FLUTTERING FROM THE WALLS ABOVE THE KITCHEN RANGEAS THE DAWN GREW CLEARER WE SAW THROUGH THE GAP IN THE WALL THEBODY OF A MARTIAN STANDING SENTINEL I SUPPOSE OVER THE STILLGLOWING CYLINDER  AT THE SIGHT OF THAT WE CRAWLED AS CIRCUMSPECTLY ASPOSSIBLE OUT OF THE TWILIGHT OF THE KITCHEN INTO THE DARKNESS OF THESCULLERYABRUPTLY THE RIGHT INTERPRETATION DAWNED UPON MY MINDTHE FIFTH CYLINDER I WHISPERED THE FIFTH SHOT FROM MARS HASSTRUCK THIS HOUSE AND BURIED US UNDER THE RUINSFOR A TIME THE CURATE WAS SILENT AND THEN HE WHISPEREDGOD HAVE MERCY UPON USI HEARD HIM PRESENTLY WHIMPERING TO HIMSELFSAVE FOR THAT SOUND WE LAY QUITE STILL IN THE SCULLERY I FOR MYPART SCARCE DARED BREATHE AND SAT WITH MY EYES FIXED ON THE FAINTLIGHT OF THE KITCHEN DOOR  I COULD JUST SEE THE CURATES FACE A DIMOVAL SHAPE AND HIS COLLAR AND CUFFS  OUTSIDE THERE BEGAN A METALLICHAMMERING THEN A VIOLENT HOOTING AND THEN AGAIN AFTER A QUIETINTERVAL A HISSING LIKE THE HISSING OF AN ENGINE  THESE NOISES FORTHE MOST PART PROBLEMATICAL CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY AND SEEMED IFANYTHING TO INCREASE IN NUMBER AS TIME WORE ON  PRESENTLY A MEASUREDTHUDDING AND A VIBRATION THAT MADE EVERYTHING ABOUT US QUIVER AND THEVESSELS IN THE PANTRY RING AND SHIFT BEGAN AND CONTINUED  ONCE THELIGHT WAS ECLIPSED AND THE GHOSTLY KITCHEN DOORWAY BECAME ABSOLUTELYDARK  FOR MANY HOURS WE MUST HAVE CROUCHED THERE SILENT ANDSHIVERING UNTIL OUR TIRED ATTENTION FAILED   AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF AWAKE AND VERY HUNGRY  I AM INCLINED TOBELIEVE WE MUST HAVE SPENT THE GREATER PORTION OF A DAY BEFORE THATAWAKENING  MY HUNGER WAS AT A STRIDE SO INSISTENT THAT IT MOVED ME TOACTION  I TOLD THE CURATE I WAS GOING TO SEEK FOOD AND FELT MY WAYTOWARDS THE PANTRY  HE MADE ME NO ANSWER BUT SO SOON AS I BEGANEATING THE FAINT NOISE I MADE STIRRED HIM UP AND I HEARD HIM CRAWLINGAFTER MECHAPTER TWOWHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSEAFTER EATING WE CREPT BACK TO THE SCULLERY AND THERE I MUST HAVEDOZED AGAIN FOR WHEN PRESENTLY I LOOKED ROUND I WAS ALONE  THETHUDDING VIBRATION CONTINUED WITH WEARISOME PERSISTENCE  I WHISPEREDFOR THE CURATE SEVERAL TIMES AND AT LAST FELT MY WAY TO THE DOOR OFTHE KITCHEN  IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT AND I PERCEIVED HIM ACROSS THEROOM LYING AGAINST THE TRIANGULAR HOLE THAT LOOKED OUT UPON THEMARTIANS  HIS SHOULDERS WERE HUNCHED SO THAT HIS HEAD WAS HIDDENFROM MEI COULD HEAR A NUMBER OF NOISES ALMOST LIKE THOSE IN AN ENGINESHED AND THE PLACE ROCKED WITH THAT BEATING THUD  THROUGH THEAPERTURE IN THE WALL I COULD SEE THE TOP OF A TREE TOUCHED WITH GOLDAND THE WARM BLUE OF A TRANQUIL EVENING SKY  FOR A MINUTE OR SO IREMAINED WATCHING THE CURATE AND THEN I ADVANCED CROUCHING ANDSTEPPING WITH EXTREME CARE AMID THE BROKEN CROCKERY THAT LITTERED THEFLOORI TOUCHED THE CURATES LEG AND HE STARTED SO VIOLENTLY THAT A MASSOF PLASTER WENT SLIDING DOWN OUTSIDE AND FELL WITH A LOUD IMPACT  IGRIPPED HIS ARM FEARING HE MIGHT CRY OUT AND FOR A LONG TIME WECROUCHED MOTIONLESS  THEN I TURNED TO SEE HOW MUCH OF OUR RAMPARTREMAINED  THE DETACHMENT OF THE PLASTER HAD LEFT A VERTICAL SLIT OPENIN THE DEBRIS AND BY RAISING MYSELF CAUTIOUSLY ACROSS A BEAM I WASABLE TO SEE OUT OF THIS GAP INTO WHAT HAD BEEN OVERNIGHT A QUIETSUBURBAN ROADWAY  VAST INDEED WAS THE CHANGE THAT WE BEHELDTHE FIFTH CYLINDER MUST HAVE FALLEN RIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THEHOUSE WE HAD FIRST VISITED  THE BUILDING HAD VANISHED COMPLETELYSMASHED PULVERISED AND DISPERSED BY THE BLOW  THE CYLINDER LAY NOWFAR BENEATH THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATIONSDEEP IN A HOLE ALREADY VASTLYLARGER THAN THE PIT I HAD LOOKED INTO AT WOKING  THE EARTH ALL ROUNDIT HAD SPLASHED UNDER THAT TREMENDOUS IMPACTSPLASHED IS THE ONLYWORDAND LAY IN HEAPED PILES THAT HID THE MASSES OF THE ADJACENTHOUSES  IT HAD BEHAVED EXACTLY LIKE MUD UNDER THE VIOLENT BLOW OF AHAMMER  OUR HOUSE HAD COLLAPSED BACKWARD THE FRONT PORTION EVEN ONTHE GROUND FLOOR HAD BEEN DESTROYED COMPLETELY BY A CHANCE THEKITCHEN AND SCULLERY HAD ESCAPED AND STOOD BURIED NOW UNDER SOIL ANDRUINS CLOSED IN BY TONS OF EARTH ON EVERY SIDE SAVE TOWARDS THECYLINDER  OVER THAT ASPECT WE HUNG NOW ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GREATCIRCULAR PIT THE MARTIANS WERE ENGAGED IN MAKING  THE HEAVY BEATINGSOUND WAS EVIDENTLY JUST BEHIND US AND EVER AND AGAIN A BRIGHT GREENVAPOUR DROVE UP LIKE A VEIL ACROSS OUR PEEPHOLETHE CYLINDER WAS ALREADY OPENED IN THE CENTRE OF THE PIT AND ONTHE FARTHER EDGE OF THE PIT AMID THE SMASHED AND GRAVELHEAPEDSHRUBBERY ONE OF THE GREAT FIGHTINGMACHINES DESERTED BY ITSOCCUPANT STOOD STIFF AND TALL AGAINST THE EVENING SKY  AT FIRST ISCARCELY NOTICED THE PIT AND THE CYLINDER ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEENCONVENIENT TO DESCRIBE THEM FIRST ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTRAORDINARYGLITTERING MECHANISM I SAW BUSY IN THE EXCAVATION AND ON ACCOUNT OFTHE STRANGE CREATURES THAT WERE CRAWLING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY ACROSSTHE HEAPED MOULD NEAR ITTHE MECHANISM IT CERTAINLY WAS THAT HELD MY ATTENTION FIRST  ITWAS ONE OF THOSE COMPLICATED FABRICS THAT HAVE SINCE BEEN CALLEDHANDLINGMACHINES AND THE STUDY OF WHICH HAS ALREADY GIVEN SUCH ANENORMOUS IMPETUS TO TERRESTRIAL INVENTION  AS IT DAWNED UPON MEFIRST IT PRESENTED A SORT OF METALLIC SPIDER WITH FIVE JOINTEDAGILE LEGS AND WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF JOINTED LEVERS BARSAND REACHING AND CLUTCHING TENTACLES ABOUT ITS BODY  MOST OF ITSARMS WERE RETRACTED BUT WITH THREE LONG TENTACLES IT WAS FISHINGOUT A NUMBER OF RODS PLATES AND BARS WHICH LINED THE COVERING ANDAPPARENTLY STRENGTHENED THE WALLS OF THE CYLINDER  THESE AS ITEXTRACTED THEM WERE LIFTED OUT AND DEPOSITED UPON A LEVEL SURFACEOF EARTH BEHIND ITITS MOTION WAS SO SWIFT COMPLEX AND PERFECT THAT AT FIRST I DIDNOT SEE IT AS A MACHINE IN SPITE OF ITS METALLIC GLITTER  THEFIGHTINGMACHINES WERE COORDINATED AND ANIMATED TO AN EXTRAORDINARYPITCH BUT NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH THIS  PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEENTHESE STRUCTURES AND HAVE ONLY THE ILLIMAGINED EFFORTS OF ARTISTS ORTHE IMPERFECT DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH EYEWITNESSES AS MYSELF TO GO UPONSCARCELY REALISE THAT LIVING QUALITYI RECALL PARTICULARLY THE ILLUSTRATION OF ONE OF THE FIRSTPAMPHLETS TO GIVE A CONSECUTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE WAR  THE ARTIST HADEVIDENTLY MADE A HASTY STUDY OF ONE OF THE FIGHTINGMACHINES ANDTHERE HIS KNOWLEDGE ENDED  HE PRESENTED THEM AS TILTED STIFFTRIPODS WITHOUT EITHER FLEXIBILITY OR SUBTLETY AND WITH ANALTOGETHER MISLEADING MONOTONY OF EFFECT  THE PAMPHLET CONTAININGTHESE RENDERINGS HAD A CONSIDERABLE VOGUE AND I MENTION THEM HERESIMPLY TO WARN THE READER AGAINST THE IMPRESSION THEY MAY HAVECREATED  THEY WERE NO MORE LIKE THE MARTIANS I SAW IN ACTION THAN ADUTCH DOLL IS LIKE A HUMAN BEING  TO MY MIND THE PAMPHLET WOULD HAVEBEEN MUCH BETTER WITHOUT THEMAT FIRST I SAY THE HANDLINGMACHINE DID NOT IMPRESS ME AS AMACHINE BUT AS A CRABLIKE CREATURE WITH A GLITTERING INTEGUMENT THECONTROLLING MARTIAN WHOSE DELICATE TENTACLES ACTUATED ITS MOVEMENTSSEEMING TO BE SIMPLY THE EQUIVALENT OF THE CRABS CEREBRAL PORTIONBUT THEN I PERCEIVED THE RESEMBLANCE OF ITS GREYBROWN SHINYLEATHERY INTEGUMENT TO THAT OF THE OTHER SPRAWLING BODIES BEYOND ANDTHE TRUE NATURE OF THIS DEXTEROUS WORKMAN DAWNED UPON ME  WITH THATREALISATION MY INTEREST SHIFTED TO THOSE OTHER CREATURES THE REALMARTIANS  ALREADY I HAD HAD A TRANSIENT IMPRESSION OF THESE AND THEFIRST NAUSEA NO LONGER OBSCURED MY OBSERVATION  MOREOVER I WASCONCEALED AND MOTIONLESS AND UNDER NO URGENCY OF ACTIONTHEY WERE I NOW SAW THE MOST UNEARTHLY CREATURES IT IS POSSIBLETO CONCEIVE  THEY WERE HUGE ROUND BODIESOR RATHER HEADSABOUTFOUR FEET IN DIAMETER EACH BODY HAVING IN FRONT OF IT A FACE  THISFACE HAD NO NOSTRILSINDEED THE MARTIANS DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE HAD ANYSENSE OF SMELL BUT IT HAD A PAIR OF VERY LARGE DARKCOLOURED EYESAND JUST BENEATH THIS A KIND OF FLESHY BEAK  IN THE BACK OF THIS HEADOR BODYI SCARCELY KNOW HOW TO SPEAK OF ITWAS THE SINGLE TIGHTTYMPANIC SURFACE SINCE KNOWN TO BE ANATOMICALLY AN EAR THOUGH ITMUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST USELESS IN OUR DENSE AIR  IN A GROUP ROUND THEMOUTH WERE SIXTEEN SLENDER ALMOST WHIPLIKE TENTACLES ARRANGED IN TWOBUNCHES OF EIGHT EACH  THESE BUNCHES HAVE SINCE BEEN NAMED RATHERAPTLY BY THAT DISTINGUISHED ANATOMIST PROFESSOR HOWES THE HANDSEVEN AS I SAW THESE MARTIANS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SEEMED TO BEENDEAVOURING TO RAISE THEMSELVES ON THESE HANDS BUT OF COURSE WITHTHE INCREASED WEIGHT OF TERRESTRIAL CONDITIONS THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLETHERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ON MARS THEY MAY HAVE PROGRESSED UPONTHEM WITH SOME FACILITYTHE INTERNAL ANATOMY I MAY REMARK HERE AS DISSECTION HAS SINCESHOWN WAS ALMOST EQUALLY SIMPLE  THE GREATER PART OF THE STRUCTUREWAS THE BRAIN SENDING ENORMOUS NERVES TO THE EYES EAR AND TACTILETENTACLES  BESIDES THIS WERE THE BULKY LUNGS INTO WHICH THE MOUTHOPENED AND THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS  THE PULMONARY DISTRESS CAUSEDBY THE DENSER ATMOSPHERE AND GREATER GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION WAS ONLYTOO EVIDENT IN THE CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS OF THE OUTER SKINAND THIS WAS THE SUM OF THE MARTIAN ORGANS  STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEMTO A HUMAN BEING ALL THE COMPLEX APPARATUS OF DIGESTION WHICH MAKESUP THE BULK OF OUR BODIES DID NOT EXIST IN THE MARTIANS  THEY WEREHEADSMERELY HEADS  ENTRAILS THEY HAD NONE  THEY DID NOT EAT MUCHLESS DIGEST  INSTEAD THEY TOOK THE FRESH LIVING BLOOD OF OTHERCREATURES AND INJECTED IT INTO THEIR OWN VEINS  I HAVE MYSELF SEENTHIS BEING DONE AS I SHALL MENTION IN ITS PLACE  BUT SQUEAMISH AS IMAY SEEM I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DESCRIBE WHAT I COULD NOT ENDUREEVEN TO CONTINUE WATCHING  LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY BLOOD OBTAINED FROMA STILL LIVING ANIMAL IN MOST CASES FROM A HUMAN BEING WAS RUNDIRECTLY BY MEANS OF A LITTLE PIPETTE INTO THE RECIPIENT CANAL   THE BARE IDEA OF THIS IS NO DOUBT HORRIBLY REPULSIVE TO US BUT ATTHE SAME TIME I THINK THAT WE SHOULD REMEMBER HOW REPULSIVE OURCARNIVOROUS HABITS WOULD SEEM TO AN INTELLIGENT RABBITTHE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF THE PRACTICE OF INJECTION AREUNDENIABLE IF ONE THINKS OF THE TREMENDOUS WASTE OF HUMAN TIME ANDENERGY OCCASIONED BY EATING AND THE DIGESTIVE PROCESS  OUR BODIES AREHALF MADE UP OF GLANDS AND TUBES AND ORGANS OCCUPIED IN TURNINGHETEROGENEOUS FOOD INTO BLOOD  THE DIGESTIVE PROCESSES AND THEIRREACTION UPON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SAP OUR STRENGTH AND COLOUR OURMINDS  MEN GO HAPPY OR MISERABLE AS THEY HAVE HEALTHY OR UNHEALTHYLIVERS OR SOUND GASTRIC GLANDS  BUT THE MARTIANS WERE LIFTED ABOVEALL THESE ORGANIC FLUCTUATIONS OF MOOD AND EMOTIONTHEIR UNDENIABLE PREFERENCE FOR MEN AS THEIR SOURCE OF NOURISHMENTIS PARTLY EXPLAINED BY THE NATURE OF THE REMAINS OF THE VICTIMS THEYHAD BROUGHT WITH THEM AS PROVISIONS FROM MARS  THESE CREATURES TOJUDGE FROM THE SHRIVELLED REMAINS THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO HUMAN HANDSWERE BIPEDS WITH FLIMSY SILICIOUS SKELETONS ALMOST LIKE THOSE OF THESILICIOUS SPONGES AND FEEBLE MUSCULATURE STANDING ABOUT SIX FEETHIGH AND HAVING ROUND ERECT HEADS AND LARGE EYES IN FLINTY SOCKETSTWO OR THREE OF THESE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN EACH CYLINDER ANDALL WERE KILLED BEFORE EARTH WAS REACHED  IT WAS JUST AS WELL FORTHEM FOR THE MERE ATTEMPT TO STAND UPRIGHT UPON OUR PLANET WOULD HAVEBROKEN EVERY BONE IN THEIR BODIESAND WHILE I AM ENGAGED IN THIS DESCRIPTION I MAY ADD IN THIS PLACECERTAIN FURTHER DETAILS WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT ALL EVIDENT TOUS AT THE TIME WILL ENABLE THE READER WHO IS UNACQUAINTED WITH THEMTO FORM A CLEARER PICTURE OF THESE OFFENSIVE CREATURESIN THREE OTHER POINTS THEIR PHYSIOLOGY DIFFERED STRANGELY FROMOURS  THEIR ORGANISMS DID NOT SLEEP ANY MORE THAN THE HEART OF MANSLEEPS  SINCE THEY HAD NO EXTENSIVE MUSCULAR MECHANISM TO RECUPERATETHAT PERIODICAL EXTINCTION WAS UNKNOWN TO THEM  THEY HAD LITTLE ORNO SENSE OF FATIGUE IT WOULD SEEM  ON EARTH THEY COULD NEVER HAVEMOVED WITHOUT EFFORT YET EVEN TO THE LAST THEY KEPT IN ACTION  INTWENTYFOUR HOURS THEY DID TWENTYFOUR HOURS OF WORK AS EVEN ON EARTHIS PERHAPS THE CASE WITH THE ANTSIN THE NEXT PLACE WONDERFUL AS IT SEEMS IN A SEXUAL WORLD THEMARTIANS WERE ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT SEX AND THEREFORE WITHOUT ANY OF THETUMULTUOUS EMOTIONS THAT ARISE FROM THAT DIFFERENCE AMONG MEN  AYOUNG MARTIAN THERE CAN NOW BE NO DISPUTE WAS REALLY BORN UPON EARTHDURING THE WAR AND IT WAS FOUND ATTACHED TO ITS PARENT PARTIALLYBUDDED OFF JUST AS YOUNG LILYBULBS BUD OFF OR LIKE THE YOUNG ANIMALSIN THE FRESHWATER POLYPIN MAN IN ALL THE HIGHER TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS SUCH A METHOD OFINCREASE HAS DISAPPEARED BUT EVEN ON THIS EARTH IT WAS CERTAINLY THEPRIMITIVE METHOD  AMONG THE LOWER ANIMALS UP EVEN TO THOSE FIRSTCOUSINS OF THE VERTEBRATED ANIMALS THE TUNICATES THE TWO PROCESSESOCCUR SIDE BY SIDE BUT FINALLY THE SEXUAL METHOD SUPERSEDED ITSCOMPETITOR ALTOGETHER  ON MARS HOWEVER JUST THE REVERSE HASAPPARENTLY BEEN THE CASEIT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT A CERTAIN SPECULATIVE WRITER OFQUASISCIENTIFIC REPUTE WRITING LONG BEFORE THE MARTIAN INVASION DIDFORECAST FOR MAN A FINAL STRUCTURE NOT UNLIKE THE ACTUAL MARTIANCONDITION  HIS PROPHECY I REMEMBER APPEARED IN NOVEMBER ORDECEMBER  IN A LONGDEFUNCT PUBLICATION THE PALL MALL BUDGETAND I RECALL A CARICATURE OF IT IN A PREMARTIAN PERIODICAL CALLEDPUNCH  HE POINTED OUTWRITING IN A FOOLISH FACETIOUS TONETHAT THEPERFECTION OF MECHANICAL APPLIANCES MUST ULTIMATELY SUPERSEDE LIMBSTHE PERFECTION OF CHEMICAL DEVICES DIGESTION THAT SUCH ORGANS ASHAIR EXTERNAL NOSE TEETH EARS AND CHIN WERE NO LONGER ESSENTIALPARTS OF THE HUMAN

BODY HAD A STRONG CASE FOR SURVIVAL AND THAT WASTHE HAND TEACHER AND AGENT OF THE BRAIN  WHILE THE REST OF THEBODY DWINDLED THE HANDS WOULD GROW LARGERTHERE IS MANY A TRUE WORD WRITTEN IN JEST AND HERE IN THE MARTIANSWE HAVE BEYOND DISPUTE THE ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SUCH A SUPPRESSIONOF THE ANIMAL SIDE OF THE ORGANISM BY THE INTELLIGENCE  TO ME IT ISQUITE CREDIBLE THAT THE MARTIANS MAY BE DESCENDED FROM BEINGS NOTUNLIKE OURSELVES BY A GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN AND HANDS THELATTER GIVING RISE TO THE TWO BUNCHES OF DELICATE TENTACLES AT LASTAT THE EXPENSE OF THE REST OF THE BODY  WITHOUT THE BODY THE BRAINWOULD OF COURSE BECOME A MERE SELFISH INTELLIGENCE WITHOUT ANY OFTHE EMOTIONAL SUBSTRATUM OF THE HUMAN BEINGTHE LAST SALIENT POINT IN WHICH THE SYSTEMS OF THESE CREATURESDIFFERED FROM OURS WAS IN WHAT ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT A VERY TRIVIALPARTICULAR  MICROORGANISMS WHICH CAUSE SO MUCH DISEASE AND PAIN ONEARTH HAVE EITHER NEVER APPEARED UPON MARS OR MARTIAN SANITARYSCIENCE ELIMINATED THEM AGES AGO  A HUNDRED DISEASES ALL THE FEVERSAND CONTAGIONS OF HUMAN LIFE CONSUMPTION CANCERS TUMOURS AND SUCHMORBIDITIES NEVER ENTER THE SCHEME OF THEIR LIFE  AND SPEAKING OFTHE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LIFE ON MARS AND TERRESTRIAL LIFE I MAYALLUDE HERE TO THE CURIOUS SUGGESTIONS OF THE RED WEEDAPPARENTLY THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM IN MARS INSTEAD OF HAVING GREENFOR A DOMINANT COLOUR IS OF A VIVID BLOODRED TINT  AT ANY RATE THESEEDS WHICH THE MARTIANS INTENTIONALLY OR ACCIDENTALLY BROUGHT WITHTHEM GAVE RISE IN ALL CASES TO REDCOLOURED GROWTHS  ONLY THAT KNOWNPOPULARLY AS THE RED WEED HOWEVER GAINED ANY FOOTING IN COMPETITIONWITH TERRESTRIAL FORMS  THE RED CREEPER WAS QUITE A TRANSITORYGROWTH AND FEW PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT GROWING  FOR A TIME HOWEVER THERED WEED GREW WITH ASTONISHING VIGOUR AND LUXURIANCE  IT SPREAD UPTHE SIDES OF THE PIT BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH DAY OF OUR IMPRISONMENTAND ITS CACTUSLIKE BRANCHES FORMED A CARMINE FRINGE TO THE EDGES OFOUR TRIANGULAR WINDOW  AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND IT BROADCAST THROUGHOUTTHE COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY WHEREVER THERE WAS A STREAM OF WATERTHE MARTIANS HAD WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN AUDITORY ORGAN ASINGLE ROUND DRUM AT THE BACK OF THE HEADBODY AND EYES WITH A VISUALRANGE NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM OURS EXCEPT THAT ACCORDING TO PHILIPSBLUE AND VIOLET WERE AS BLACK TO THEM  IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED THATTHEY COMMUNICATED BY SOUNDS AND TENTACULAR GESTICULATIONS THIS ISASSERTED FOR INSTANCE IN THE ABLE BUT HASTILY COMPILED PAMPHLETWRITTEN EVIDENTLY BY SOMEONE NOT AN EYEWITNESS OF MARTIAN ACTIONSTO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED AND WHICH SO FAR HAS BEEN THE CHIEFSOURCE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING THEM  NOW NO SURVIVING HUMAN BEINGSAW SO MUCH OF THE MARTIANS IN ACTION AS I DID  I TAKE NO CREDIT TOMYSELF FOR AN ACCIDENT BUT THE FACT IS SO  AND I ASSERT THAT IWATCHED THEM CLOSELY TIME AFTER TIME AND THAT I HAVE SEEN FOUR FIVEAND ONCE SIX OF THEM SLUGGISHLY PERFORMING THE MOST ELABORATELYCOMPLICATED OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITHOUT EITHER SOUND OR GESTURE  THEIRPECULIAR HOOTING INVARIABLY PRECEDED FEEDING IT HAD NO MODULATIONAND WAS I BELIEVE IN NO SENSE A SIGNAL BUT MERELY THE EXPIRATION OFAIR PREPARATORY TO THE SUCTIONAL OPERATION  I HAVE A CERTAIN CLAIM TOAT LEAST AN ELEMENTARY KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY AND IN THIS MATTER IAM CONVINCEDAS FIRMLY AS I AM CONVINCED OF ANYTHINGTHAT THEMARTIANS INTERCHANGED THOUGHTS WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL INTERMEDIATIONAND I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED OF THIS IN SPITE OF STRONG PRECONCEPTIONSBEFORE THE MARTIAN INVASION AS AN OCCASIONAL READER HERE OR THERE MAYREMEMBER I HAD WRITTEN WITH SOME LITTLE VEHEMENCE AGAINST THETELEPATHIC THEORYTHE MARTIANS WORE NO CLOTHING  THEIR CONCEPTIONS OF ORNAMENT ANDDECORUM WERE NECESSARILY DIFFERENT FROM OURS AND NOT ONLY WERE THEYEVIDENTLY MUCH LESS SENSIBLE OF CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAN WE AREBUT CHANGES OF PRESSURE DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE AFFECTED THEIR HEALTH ATALL SERIOUSLY  YET THOUGH THEY WORE NO CLOTHING IT WAS IN THE OTHERARTIFICIAL ADDITIONS TO THEIR BODILY RESOURCES THAT THEIR GREATSUPERIORITY OVER MAN LAY  WE MEN WITH OUR BICYCLES AND ROADSKATESOUR LILIENTHAL SOARINGMACHINES OUR GUNS AND STICKS AND SO FORTH AREJUST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EVOLUTION THAT THE MARTIANS HAVE WORKEDOUT  THEY HAVE BECOME PRACTICALLY MERE BRAINS WEARING DIFFERENTBODIES ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS JUST AS MEN WEAR SUITS OF CLOTHES ANDTAKE A BICYCLE IN A HURRY OR AN UMBRELLA IN THE WET  AND OF THEIRAPPLIANCES PERHAPS NOTHING IS MORE WONDERFUL TO A MAN THAN THECURIOUS FACT THAT WHAT IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF ALMOST ALL HUMANDEVICES IN MECHANISM IS ABSENTTHE WHEEL IS ABSENT AMONG ALL THETHINGS THEY BROUGHT TO EARTH THERE IS NO TRACE OR SUGGESTION OF THEIRUSE OF WHEELS  ONE WOULD HAVE AT LEAST EXPECTED IT IN LOCOMOTION  ANDIN THIS CONNECTION IT IS CURIOUS TO REMARK THAT EVEN ON THIS EARTHNATURE HAS NEVER HIT UPON THE WHEEL OR HAS PREFERRED OTHER EXPEDIENTSTO ITS DEVELOPMENT  AND NOT ONLY DID THE MARTIANS EITHER NOT KNOW OFWHICH IS INCREDIBLE OR ABSTAIN FROM THE WHEEL BUT IN THEIRAPPARATUS SINGULARLY LITTLE USE IS MADE OF THE FIXED PIVOT ORRELATIVELY FIXED PIVOT WITH CIRCULAR MOTIONS THEREABOUT CONFINEDTO ONE PLANE  ALMOST ALL THE JOINTS OF THE MACHINERY PRESENT ACOMPLICATED SYSTEM OF SLIDING PARTS MOVING OVER SMALL BUT BEAUTIFULLYCURVED FRICTION BEARINGS  AND WHILE UPON THIS MATTER OF DETAIL IT ISREMARKABLE THAT THE LONG LEVERAGES OF THEIR MACHINES ARE IN MOST CASESACTUATED BY A SORT OF SHAM MUSCULATURE OF THE DISKS IN AN ELASTICSHEATH THESE DISKS BECOME POLARISED AND DRAWN CLOSELY AND POWERFULLYTOGETHER WHEN TRAVERSED BY A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY  IN THIS WAY THECURIOUS PARALLELISM TO ANIMAL MOTIONS WHICH WAS SO STRIKING ANDDISTURBING TO THE HUMAN BEHOLDER WAS ATTAINED  SUCH QUASIMUSCLESABOUNDED IN THE CRABLIKE HANDLINGMACHINE WHICH ON MY FIRST PEEPINGOUT OF THE SLIT I WATCHED UNPACKING THE CYLINDER  IT SEEMEDINFINITELY MORE ALIVE THAN THE ACTUAL MARTIANS LYING BEYOND IT IN THESUNSET LIGHT PANTING STIRRING INEFFECTUAL TENTACLES AND MOVINGFEEBLY AFTER THEIR VAST JOURNEY ACROSS SPACEWHILE I WAS STILL WATCHING THEIR SLUGGISH MOTIONS IN THE SUNLIGHTAND NOTING EACH STRANGE DETAIL OF THEIR FORM THE CURATE REMINDED MEOF HIS PRESENCE BY PULLING VIOLENTLY AT MY ARM  I TURNED TO ASCOWLING FACE AND SILENT ELOQUENT LIPS  HE WANTED THE SLIT WHICHPERMITTED ONLY ONE OF US TO PEEP THROUGH AND SO I HAD TO FOREGOWATCHING THEM FOR A TIME WHILE HE ENJOYED THAT PRIVILEGEWHEN I LOOKED AGAIN THE BUSY HANDLINGMACHINE HAD ALREADY PUTTOGETHER SEVERAL OF THE PIECES OF APPARATUS IT HAD TAKEN OUT OF THECYLINDER INTO A SHAPE HAVING AN UNMISTAKABLE LIKENESS TO ITS OWN ANDDOWN ON THE LEFT A BUSY LITTLE DIGGING MECHANISM HAD COME INTO VIEWEMITTING JETS OF GREEN VAPOUR AND WORKING ITS WAY ROUND THE PITEXCAVATING AND EMBANKING IN A METHODICAL AND DISCRIMINATING MANNERTHIS IT WAS WHICH HAD CAUSED THE REGULAR BEATING NOISE AND THERHYTHMIC SHOCKS THAT HAD KEPT OUR RUINOUS REFUGE QUIVERING  IT PIPEDAND WHISTLED AS IT WORKED  SO FAR AS I COULD SEE THE THING WASWITHOUT A DIRECTING MARTIAN AT ALLCHAPTER THREETHE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENTTHE ARRIVAL OF A SECOND FIGHTINGMACHINE DROVE US FROM OUR PEEPHOLEINTO THE SCULLERY FOR WE FEARED THAT FROM HIS ELEVATION THE MARTIANMIGHT SEE DOWN UPON US BEHIND OUR BARRIER  AT A LATER DATE WE BEGANTO FEEL LESS IN DANGER OF THEIR EYES FOR TO AN EYE IN THE DAZZLE OFTHE SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE OUR REFUGE MUST HAVE BEEN BLANK BLACKNESS BUT ATFIRST THE SLIGHTEST SUGGESTION OF APPROACH DROVE US INTO THE SCULLERYIN HEARTTHROBBING RETREAT  YET TERRIBLE AS WAS THE DANGER WEINCURRED THE ATTRACTION OF PEEPING WAS FOR BOTH OF US IRRESISTIBLEAND I RECALL NOW WITH A SORT OF WONDER THAT IN SPITE OF THE INFINITEDANGER IN WHICH WE WERE BETWEEN STARVATION AND A STILL MORE TERRIBLEDEATH WE COULD YET STRUGGLE BITTERLY FOR THAT HORRIBLE PRIVILEGE OFSIGHT  WE WOULD RACE ACROSS THE KITCHEN IN A GROTESQUE WAY BETWEENEAGERNESS AND THE DREAD OF MAKING A NOISE AND STRIKE EACH OTHER ANDTHRUST AND KICK WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF EXPOSURETHE FACT IS THAT WE HAD ABSOLUTELY INCOMPATIBLE DISPOSITIONS ANDHABITS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION AND OUR DANGER AND ISOLATION ONLYACCENTUATED THE INCOMPATIBILITY  AT HALLIFORD I HAD ALREADY COME TOHATE THE CURATES TRICK OF HELPLESS EXCLAMATION HIS STUPID RIGIDITYOF MIND  HIS ENDLESS MUTTERING MONOLOGUE VITIATED EVERY EFFORT I MADETO THINK OUT A LINE OF ACTION AND DROVE ME AT TIMES THUS PENT UP ANDINTENSIFIED ALMOST TO THE VERGE OF CRAZINESS  HE WAS AS LACKING INRESTRAINT AS A SILLY WOMAN  HE WOULD WEEP FOR HOURS TOGETHER AND IVERILY BELIEVE THAT TO THE VERY END THIS SPOILED CHILD OF LIFE THOUGHTHIS WEAK TEARS IN SOME WAY EFFICACIOUS  AND I WOULD SIT IN THEDARKNESS UNABLE TO KEEP MY MIND OFF HIM BY REASON OF HISIMPORTUNITIES  HE ATE MORE THAN I DID AND IT WAS IN VAIN I POINTEDOUT THAT OUR ONLY CHANCE OF LIFE WAS TO STOP IN THE HOUSE UNTIL THEMARTIANS HAD DONE WITH THEIR PIT THAT IN THAT LONG PATIENCE A TIMEMIGHT PRESENTLY COME WHEN WE SHOULD NEED FOOD  HE ATE AND DRANKIMPULSIVELY IN HEAVY MEALS AT LONG INTERVALS  HE SLEPT LITTLEAS THE DAYS WORE ON HIS UTTER CARELESSNESS OF ANY CONSIDERATION SOINTENSIFIED OUR DISTRESS AND DANGER THAT I HAD MUCH AS I LOATHEDDOING IT TO RESORT TO THREATS AND AT LAST TO BLOWS  THAT BROUGHT HIMTO REASON FOR A TIME  BUT HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WEAK CREATURES VOID OFPRIDE TIMOROUS ANAEMIC HATEFUL SOULS FULL OF SHIFTY CUNNING WHOFACE NEITHER GOD NOR MAN WHO FACE NOT EVEN THEMSELVESIT IS DISAGREEABLE FOR ME TO RECALL AND WRITE THESE THINGS BUT ISET THEM DOWN THAT MY STORY MAY LACK NOTHING  THOSE WHO HAVE ESCAPEDTHE DARK AND TERRIBLE ASPECTS OF LIFE WILL FIND MY BRUTALITY MY FLASHOF RAGE IN OUR FINAL TRAGEDY EASY ENOUGH TO BLAME FOR THEY KNOW WHATIS WRONG AS WELL AS ANY BUT NOT WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO TORTURED MEN  BUTTHOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SHADOW WHO HAVE GONE DOWN AT LAST TOELEMENTAL THINGS WILL HAVE A WIDER CHARITYAND WHILE WITHIN WE FOUGHT OUT OUR DARK DIM CONTEST OF WHISPERSSNATCHED FOOD AND DRINK AND GRIPPING HANDS AND BLOWS WITHOUT IN THEPITILESS SUNLIGHT OF THAT TERRIBLE JUNE WAS THE STRANGE WONDER THEUNFAMILIAR ROUTINE OF THE MARTIANS IN THE PIT  LET ME RETURN TO THOSEFIRST NEW EXPERIENCES OF MINE  AFTER A LONG TIME I VENTURED BACK TOTHE PEEPHOLE TO FIND THAT THE NEWCOMERS HAD BEEN REINFORCED BY THEOCCUPANTS OF NO FEWER THAN THREE OF THE FIGHTINGMACHINES  THESE LASTHAD BROUGHT WITH THEM CERTAIN FRESH APPLIANCES THAT STOOD IN ANORDERLY MANNER ABOUT THE CYLINDER  THE SECOND HANDLINGMACHINE WAS NOWCOMPLETED AND WAS BUSIED IN SERVING ONE OF THE NOVEL CONTRIVANCES THEBIG MACHINE HAD BROUGHT  THIS WAS A BODY RESEMBLING A MILK CAN IN ITSGENERAL FORM ABOVE WHICH OSCILLATED A PEARSHAPED RECEPTACLE ANDFROM WHICH A STREAM OF WHITE POWDER FLOWED INTO A CIRCULAR BASINBELOWTHE OSCILLATORY MOTION WAS IMPARTED TO THIS BY ONE TENTACLE OF THEHANDLINGMACHINE  WITH TWO SPATULATE HANDS THE HANDLINGMACHINE WASDIGGING OUT AND FLINGING MASSES OF CLAY INTO THE PEARSHAPEDRECEPTACLE ABOVE WHILE WITH ANOTHER ARM IT PERIODICALLY OPENED A DOORAND REMOVED RUSTY AND BLACKENED CLINKERS FROM THE MIDDLE PART OF THEMACHINE  ANOTHER STEELY TENTACLE DIRECTED THE POWDER FROM THE BASINALONG A RIBBED CHANNEL TOWARDS SOME RECEIVER THAT WAS HIDDEN FROM MEBY THE MOUND OF BLUISH DUST  FROM THIS UNSEEN RECEIVER A LITTLETHREAD OF GREEN SMOKE ROSE VERTICALLY INTO THE QUIET AIR  AS I LOOKEDTHE HANDLINGMACHINE WITH A FAINT AND MUSICAL CLINKING EXTENDEDTELESCOPIC FASHION A TENTACLE THAT HAD BEEN A MOMENT BEFORE A MEREBLUNT PROJECTION UNTIL ITS END WAS HIDDEN BEHIND THE MOUND OF CLAYIN ANOTHER SECOND IT HAD LIFTED A BAR OF WHITE ALUMINIUM INTO SIGHTUNTARNISHED AS YET AND SHINING DAZZLINGLY AND DEPOSITED IT IN AGROWING STACK OF BARS THAT STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE PIT  BETWEENSUNSET AND STARLIGHT THIS DEXTEROUS MACHINE MUST HAVE MADE MORE THAN AHUNDRED SUCH BARS OUT OF THE CRUDE CLAY AND THE MOUND OF BLUISH DUSTROSE STEADILY UNTIL IT TOPPED THE SIDE OF THE PITTHE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE SWIFT AND COMPLEX MOVEMENTS OF THESECONTRIVANCES AND THE INERT PANTING CLUMSINESS OF THEIR MASTERS WASACUTE AND FOR DAYS I HAD TO TELL MYSELF REPEATEDLY THAT THESE LATTERWERE INDEED THE LIVING OF THE TWO THINGSTHE CURATE HAD POSSESSION OF THE SLIT WHEN THE FIRST MEN WEREBROUGHT TO THE PIT  I WAS SITTING BELOW HUDDLED UP LISTENING WITHALL MY EARS  HE MADE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT BACKWARD AND I FEARFUL THATWE WERE OBSERVED CROUCHED IN A SPASM OF TERROR  HE CAME SLIDING DOWNTHE RUBBISH AND CREPT BESIDE ME IN THE DARKNESS INARTICULATEGESTICULATING AND FOR A MOMENT I SHARED HIS PANIC  HIS GESTURESUGGESTED A RESIGNATION OF THE SLIT AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE MYCURIOSITY GAVE ME COURAGE AND I ROSE UP STEPPED ACROSS HIM ANDCLAMBERED UP TO IT  AT FIRST I COULD SEE NO REASON FOR HIS FRANTICBEHAVIOUR  THE TWILIGHT HAD NOW COME THE STARS WERE LITTLE ANDFAINT BUT THE PIT WAS ILLUMINATED BY THE FLICKERING GREEN FIRE THATCAME FROM THE ALUMINIUMMAKING  THE WHOLE PICTURE WAS A FLICKERINGSCHEME OF GREEN GLEAMS AND SHIFTING RUSTY BLACK SHADOWS STRANGELYTRYING TO THE EYES  OVER AND THROUGH IT ALL WENT THE BATS HEEDING ITNOT AT ALL  THE SPRAWLING MARTIANS WERE NO LONGER TO BE SEEN THEMOUND OF BLUEGREEN POWDER HAD RISEN TO COVER THEM FROM SIGHT AND AFIGHTINGMACHINE WITH ITS LEGS CONTRACTED CRUMPLED AND ABBREVIATEDSTOOD ACROSS THE CORNER OF THE PIT  AND THEN AMID THE CLANGOUR OFTHE MACHINERY CAME A DRIFTING SUSPICION OF HUMAN VOICES THAT IENTERTAINED AT FIRST ONLY TO DISMISSI CROUCHED WATCHING THIS FIGHTINGMACHINE CLOSELY SATISFYINGMYSELF NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE HOOD DID INDEED CONTAIN AMARTIAN  AS THE GREEN FLAMES LIFTED I COULD SEE THE OILY GLEAM OFHIS INTEGUMENT AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS EYES  AND SUDDENLY I HEARDA YELL AND SAW A LONG TENTACLE REACHING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THEMACHINE TO THE LITTLE CAGE THAT HUNCHED UPON ITS BACK  THENSOMETHINGSOMETHING STRUGGLING VIOLENTLYWAS LIFTED HIGH AGAINST THESKY A BLACK VAGUE ENIGMA AGAINST THE STARLIGHT AND AS THIS BLACKOBJECT CAME DOWN AGAIN I SAW BY THE GREEN BRIGHTNESS THAT IT WAS AMAN  FOR AN INSTANT HE WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE  HE WAS A STOUT RUDDYMIDDLEAGED MAN WELL DRESSED THREE DAYS BEFORE HE MUST HAVE BEENWALKING THE WORLD A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE CONSEQUENCE  I COULD SEE HISSTARING EYES AND GLEAMS OF LIGHT ON HIS STUDS AND WATCH CHAIN  HEVANISHED BEHIND

AND BOLTED INTO THE SCULLERY  THE CURATE WHO HAD BEENCROUCHING SILENTLY WITH HIS ARMS OVER HIS HEAD LOOKED UP AS I PASSEDCRIED OUT QUITE LOUDLY AT MY DESERTION OF HIM AND CAME RUNNING AFTERMETHAT NIGHT AS WE LURKED IN THE SCULLERY BALANCED BETWEEN OURHORROR AND THE TERRIBLE FASCINATION THIS PEEPING HAD ALTHOUGH I FELTAN URGENT NEED OF ACTION I TRIED IN VAIN TO CONCEIVE SOME PLAN OFESCAPE BUT AFTERWARDS DURING THE SECOND DAY I WAS ABLE TO CONSIDEROUR POSITION WITH GREAT CLEARNESS  THE CURATE I FOUND WAS QUITEINCAPABLE OF DISCUSSION THIS NEW AND CULMINATING ATROCITY HAD ROBBEDHIM OF ALL VESTIGES OF REASON OR FORETHOUGHT  PRACTICALLY HE HADALREADY SUNK TO THE LEVEL OF AN ANIMAL  BUT AS THE SAYING GOES IGRIPPED MYSELF WITH BOTH HANDS  IT GREW UPON MY MIND ONCE I COULDFACE THE FACTS THAT TERRIBLE AS OUR POSITION WAS THERE WAS AS YETNO JUSTIFICATION FOR ABSOLUTE DESPAIR  OUR CHIEF CHANCE LAY IN THEPOSSIBILITY OF THE MARTIANS MAKING THE PIT NOTHING MORE THAN ATEMPORARY ENCAMPMENT  OR EVEN IF THEY KEPT IT PERMANENTLY THEY MIGHTNOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO GUARD IT AND A CHANCE OF ESCAPE MIGHT BEAFFORDED US  I ALSO WEIGHED VERY CAREFULLY THE POSSIBILITY OF OURDIGGING A WAY OUT IN A DIRECTION AWAY FROM THE PIT BUT THE CHANCES OFOUR EMERGING WITHIN SIGHT OF SOME SENTINEL FIGHTINGMACHINE SEEMED ATFIRST TOO GREAT  AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO DO ALL THE DIGGING MYSELFTHE CURATE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FAILED MEIT WAS ON THE THIRD DAY IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT THAT I SAWTHE LAD KILLED  IT WAS THE ONLY OCCASION ON WHICH I ACTUALLY SAW THEMARTIANS FEED  AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE I AVOIDED THE HOLE IN THE WALLFOR THE BETTER PART OF A DAY  I WENT INTO THE SCULLERY REMOVED THEDOOR AND SPENT SOME HOURS DIGGING WITH MY HATCHET AS SILENTLY ASPOSSIBLE BUT WHEN I HAD MADE A HOLE ABOUT A COUPLE OF FEET DEEP THELOOSE EARTH COLLAPSED NOISILY AND I DID NOT DARE CONTINUE  I LOSTHEART AND LAY DOWN ON THE SCULLERY FLOOR FOR A LONG TIME HAVING NOSPIRIT EVEN TO MOVE  AND AFTER THAT I ABANDONED ALTOGETHER THE IDEAOF ESCAPING BY EXCAVATIONIT SAYS MUCH FOR THE IMPRESSION THE MARTIANS HAD MADE UPON ME THATAT FIRST I ENTERTAINED LITTLE OR NO HOPE OF OUR ESCAPE BEING BROUGHTABOUT BY THEIR OVERTHROW THROUGH ANY HUMAN EFFORT  BUT ON THE FOURTHOR FIFTH NIGHT I HEARD A SOUND LIKE HEAVY GUNSIT WAS VERY LATE IN THE NIGHT AND THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLYTHE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN AWAY THE EXCAVATINGMACHINE AND SAVE FOR AFIGHTINGMACHINE THAT STOOD IN THE REMOTER BANK OF THE PIT AND AHANDLINGMACHINE THAT WAS BURIED OUT OF MY SIGHT IN A CORNER OF THEPIT IMMEDIATELY BENEATH MY PEEPHOLE THE PLACE WAS DESERTED BY THEMEXCEPT FOR THE PALE GLOW FROM THE HANDLINGMACHINE AND THE BARS ANDPATCHES OF WHITE MOONLIGHT THE PIT WAS IN DARKNESS AND EXCEPT FORTHE CLINKING OF THE HANDLINGMACHINE QUITE STILL  THAT NIGHT WAS ABEAUTIFUL SERENITY SAVE FOR ONE PLANET THE MOON SEEMED TO HAVE THESKY TO HERSELF  I HEARD A DOG HOWLING AND THAT FAMILIAR SOUND IT WASTHAT MADE ME LISTEN  THEN I HEARD QUITE DISTINCTLY A BOOMING EXACTLYLIKE THE SOUND OF GREAT GUNS  SIX DISTINCT REPORTS I COUNTED ANDAFTER A LONG INTERVAL SIX AGAIN  AND THAT WAS ALLCHAPTER FOURTHE DEATH OF THE CURATEIT WAS ON THE SIXTH DAY OF OUR IMPRISONMENT THAT I PEEPED FOR THELAST TIME AND PRESENTLY FOUND MYSELF ALONE  INSTEAD OF KEEPING CLOSETO ME AND TRYING TO OUST ME FROM THE SLIT THE CURATE HAD GONE BACKINTO THE SCULLERY  I WAS STRUCK BY A SUDDEN THOUGHT  I WENT BACKQUICKLY AND QUIETLY INTO THE SCULLERY  IN THE DARKNESS I HEARD THECURATE DRINKING  I SNATCHED IN THE DARKNESS AND MY FINGERS CAUGHT ABOTTLE OF BURGUNDYFOR A FEW MINUTES THERE WAS A TUSSLE  THE BOTTLE STRUCK THE FLOORAND BROKE AND I DESISTED AND ROSE  WE STOOD PANTING AND THREATENINGEACH OTHER  IN THE END I PLANTED MYSELF BETWEEN HIM AND THE FOOD ANDTOLD HIM OF MY DETERMINATION TO BEGIN A DISCIPLINE  I DIVIDED THEFOOD IN THE PANTRY INTO RATIONS TO LAST US TEN DAYS  I WOULD NOT LETHIM EAT ANY MORE THAT DAY  IN THE AFTERNOON HE MADE A FEEBLE EFFORTTO GET AT THE FOOD  I HAD BEEN DOZING BUT IN AN INSTANT I WAS AWAKEALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WE SAT FACE TO FACE I WEARY BUT RESOLUTE ANDHE WEEPING AND COMPLAINING OF HIS IMMEDIATE HUNGER  IT WAS I KNOW ANIGHT AND A DAY BUT TO ME IT SEEMEDIT SEEMS NOWAN INTERMINABLELENGTH OF TIMEAND SO OUR WIDENED INCOMPATIBILITY ENDED AT LAST IN OPEN CONFLICTFOR TWO VAST DAYS WE STRUGGLED IN UNDERTONES AND WRESTLING CONTESTSTHERE WERE TIMES WHEN I BEAT AND KICKED HIM MADLY TIMES WHEN ICAJOLED AND PERSUADED HIM AND ONCE I TRIED TO BRIBE HIM WITH THE LASTBOTTLE OF BURGUNDY FOR THERE WAS A RAINWATER PUMP FROM WHICH I COULDGET WATER  BUT NEITHER FORCE NOR KINDNESS AVAILED HE WAS INDEEDBEYOND REASON  HE WOULD NEITHER DESIST FROM HIS ATTACKS ON THE FOODNOR FROM HIS NOISY BABBLING TO HIMSELF  THE RUDIMENTARY PRECAUTIONSTO KEEP OUR IMPRISONMENT ENDURABLE HE WOULD NOT OBSERVE  SLOWLY IBEGAN TO REALISE THE COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF HIS INTELLIGENCE TOPERCEIVE THAT MY SOLE COMPANION IN THIS CLOSE AND SICKLY DARKNESS WASA MAN INSANEFROM CERTAIN VAGUE MEMORIES I AM INCLINED TO THINK MY OWN MINDWANDERED AT TIMES  I HAD STRANGE AND HIDEOUS DREAMS WHENEVER I SLEPTIT SOUNDS PARADOXICAL BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE WEAKNESSAND INSANITY OF THE CURATE WARNED ME BRACED ME AND KEPT ME A SANEMANON THE EIGHTH DAY HE BEGAN TO TALK ALOUD INSTEAD OF WHISPERING ANDNOTHING I COULD DO WOULD MODERATE HIS SPEECHIT IS JUST O GOD HE WOULD SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT ISJUST  ON ME AND MINE BE THE PUNISHMENT LAID  WE HAVE SINNED WE HAVEFALLEN SHORT  THERE WAS POVERTY SORROW THE POOR WERE TRODDEN INTHE DUST

ON MEHETHREATENED HE WOULD SHOUT AND BRING THE MARTIANS UPON US  FOR A TIMETHAT SCARED ME BUT ANY CONCESSION WOULD HAVE SHORTENED OUR CHANCE OFESCAPE BEYOND ESTIMATING  I DEFIED HIM ALTHOUGH I FELT NO ASSURANCETHAT HE MIGHT NOT DO THIS THING  BUT THAT DAY AT ANY RATE HE DIDNOT  HE TALKED WITH HIS VOICE RISING SLOWLY THROUGH THE GREATER PARTOF THE EIGHTH AND NINTH DAYSTHREATS ENTREATIES MINGLED WITH ATORRENT OF HALFSANE AND ALWAYS FROTHY REPENTANCE FOR HIS VACANT SHAMOF GODS SERVICE SUCH AS MADE ME PITY HIM  THEN HE SLEPT AWHILE ANDBEGAN AGAIN WITH RENEWED STRENGTH SO LOUDLY THAT I MUST NEEDS MAKEHIM DESISTBE STILL I IMPLOREDHE ROSE TO HIS KNEES FOR HE HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE DARKNESS NEARTHE COPPERI HAVE BEEN STILL TOO LONG HE SAID IN A TONE THAT MUST HAVEREACHED THE PIT AND NOW I MUST BEAR MY WITNESS  WOE UNTO THISUNFAITHFUL CITY  WOE  WOE  WOE  WOE  WOE TO THE INHABITANTS OFTHE EARTH BY REASON OF THE OTHER VOICES OF THE TRUMPETSHUT UP I SAID RISING TO MY FEET AND IN A TERROR LEST THEMARTIANS SHOULD HEAR US  FOR GODS SAKENAY SHOUTED THE CURATE AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE STANDINGLIKEWISE AND EXTENDING HIS ARMS  SPEAK  THE WORD OF THE LORD ISUPON MEIN THREE STRIDES HE WAS AT THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE KITCHENI MUST BEAR MY WITNESS  I GO  IT HAS ALREADY BEEN TOO LONGDELAYEDI PUT OUT MY HAND AND FELT THE MEAT CHOPPER HANGING TO THE WALLIN A FLASH I WAS AFTER HIM  I WAS FIERCE WITH FEAR  BEFORE HE WASHALFWAY ACROSS THE KITCHEN I HAD OVERTAKEN HIM  WITH ONE LAST TOUCHOF HUMANITY I TURNED THE BLADE BACK AND STRUCK HIM WITH THE BUTT  HEWENT HEADLONG FORWARD AND LAY STRETCHED ON THE GROUND  I STUMBLEDOVER HIM AND STOOD PANTING  HE LAY STILLSUDDENLY I HEARD A NOISE WITHOUT THE RUN AND SMASH OF SLIPPINGPLASTER AND THE TRIANGULAR APERTURE IN THE WALL WAS DARKENED  ILOOKED UP AND SAW THE LOWER SURFACE OF A HANDLINGMACHINE COMINGSLOWLY ACROSS THE HOLE  ONE OF ITS GRIPPING LIMBS CURLED AMID THEDEBRIS ANOTHER LIMB APPEARED FEELING ITS WAY OVER THE FALLEN BEAMSI STOOD PETRIFIED STARING  THEN I SAW THROUGH A SORT OF GLASS PLATENEAR THE EDGE OF THE BODY THE FACE AS WE MAY CALL IT AND THE LARGEDARK EYES OF A MARTIAN PEERING AND THEN A LONG METALLIC SNAKE OFTENTACLE CAME FEELING SLOWLY THROUGH THE HOLEI TURNED BY AN EFFORT STUMBLED OVER THE CURATE AND STOPPED AT THESCULLERY DOOR  THE TENTACLE WAS NOW SOME WAY TWO YARDS OR MORE INTHE ROOM AND TWISTING AND TURNING WITH QUEER SUDDEN MOVEMENTS THISWAY AND THAT  FOR A WHILE I STOOD FASCINATED BY THAT SLOW FITFULADVANCE  THEN WITH A FAINT HOARSE CRY I FORCED MYSELF ACROSS THESCULLERY  I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY I COULD SCARCELY STAND UPRIGHT  IOPENED THE DOOR OF THE COAL CELLAR AND STOOD THERE IN THE DARKNESSSTARING AT THE FAINTLY LIT DOORWAY INTO THE KITCHEN AND LISTENINGHAD THE MARTIAN SEEN ME  WHAT WAS IT DOING NOWSOMETHING WAS MOVING TO AND FRO THERE VERY QUIETLY EVERY NOW ANDTHEN IT TAPPED AGAINST THE WALL OR STARTED ON ITS MOVEMENTS WITH AFAINT METALLIC RINGING LIKE THE MOVEMENTS OF KEYS ON A SPLITRINGTHEN A HEAVY BODYI KNEW TOO WELL WHATWAS DRAGGED ACROSS THE FLOOROF THE KITCHEN TOWARDS THE OPENING  IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED I CREPTTO THE DOOR AND PEEPED INTO THE KITCHEN  IN THE TRIANGLE OF BRIGHTOUTER SUNLIGHT I SAW THE MARTIAN IN ITS BRIAREUS OF A HANDLINGMACHINESCRUTINIZING THE CURATES HEAD  I THOUGHT AT ONCE THAT IT WOULD INFERMY PRESENCE FROM THE MARK OF THE BLOW I HAD GIVEN HIMI CREPT BACK TO THE COAL CELLAR SHUT THE DOOR AND BEGAN TO COVERMYSELF UP AS MUCH AS I COULD AND AS NOISELESSLY AS POSSIBLE IN THEDARKNESS AMONG THE FIREWOOD AND COAL THEREIN  EVERY NOW AND THEN IPAUSED RIGID TO HEAR IF THE MARTIAN HAD THRUST ITS TENTACLES THROUGHTHE OPENING AGAINTHEN THE FAINT METALLIC JINGLE RETURNED  I TRACED IT SLOWLYFEELING OVER THE KITCHEN  PRESENTLY I HEARD IT NEARERIN THESCULLERY AS I JUDGED  I THOUGHT THAT ITS LENGTH MIGHT BEINSUFFICIENT TO REACH ME  I PRAYED COPIOUSLY  IT PASSED SCRAPINGFAINTLY ACROSS THE CELLAR DOOR  AN AGE OF ALMOST INTOLERABLE SUSPENSEINTERVENED THEN I HEARD IT FUMBLING AT THE LATCH IT HAD FOUND THEDOOR  THE MARTIANS UNDERSTOOD DOORSIT WORRIED AT THE CATCH FOR A MINUTE PERHAPS AND THEN THE DOOROPENEDIN THE DARKNESS I COULD JUST SEE THE THINGLIKE AN ELEPHANTSTRUNK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSEWAVING TOWARDS ME AND TOUCHING ANDEXAMINING THE WALL COALS WOOD AND CEILING  IT WAS LIKE A BLACK WORMSWAYING ITS BLIND HEAD TO AND FROONCE EVEN IT TOUCHED THE HEEL OF MY BOOT  I WAS ON THE VERGE OFSCREAMING I BIT MY HAND  FOR A TIME THE TENTACLE WAS SILENT  ICOULD HAVE FANCIED IT HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN  PRESENTLY WITH AN ABRUPTCLICK IT GRIPPED SOMETHINGI THOUGHT IT HAD MEAND SEEMED TO GOOUT OF THE CELLAR AGAIN  FOR A MINUTE I WAS NOT SURE  APPARENTLY ITHAD TAKEN A LUMP OF COAL TO EXAMINEI SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SLIGHTLY SHIFTING MY POSITION WHICHHAD BECOME CRAMPED AND THEN LISTENED  I WHISPERED PASSIONATE PRAYERSFOR SAFETYTHEN I HEARD THE SLOW DELIBERATE SOUND CREEPING TOWARDS ME AGAINSLOWLY SLOWLY IT DREW NEAR SCRATCHING AGAINST THE WALLS AND TAPPINGTHE FURNITUREWHILE I WAS STILL DOUBTFUL IT RAPPED SMARTLY AGAINST THE CELLARDOOR AND CLOSED IT  I HEARD IT GO INTO THE PANTRY AND THE BISCUITTINSRATTLED AND A BOTTLE SMASHED AND THEN CAME A HEAVY BUMP AGAINSTTHE CELLAR DOOR  THEN SILENCE THAT PASSED INTO AN INFINITY OFSUSPENSEHAD IT GONEAT LAST I DECIDED THAT IT HADIT CAME INTO THE SCULLERY NO MORE BUT I LAY ALL THE TENTH DAY INTHE CLOSE DARKNESS BURIED AMONG COALS AND FIREWOOD NOT DARING EVENTO CRAWL OUT FOR THE DRINK FOR WHICH I CRAVED  IT WAS THE ELEVENTH DAYBEFORE I VENTURED SO FAR FROM MY SECURITYCHAPTER FIVETHE STILLNESSMY FIRST ACT BEFORE I WENT INTO THE PANTRY WAS TO FASTEN THE DOORBETWEEN THE KITCHEN AND THE SCULLERY  BUT THE PANTRY WAS EMPTY EVERYSCRAP OF FOOD HAD GONE  APPARENTLY THE MARTIAN HAD TAKEN IT ALL ONTHE PREVIOUS DAY  AT THAT DISCOVERY I DESPAIRED FOR THE FIRST TIME  ITOOK NO FOOD OR NO DRINK EITHER ON THE ELEVENTH OR THE TWELFTH DAYAT FIRST MY MOUTH AND THROAT WERE PARCHED AND MY STRENGTH EBBEDSENSIBLY  I SAT ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE SCULLERY IN A STATE OFDESPONDENT WRETCHEDNESS  MY MIND RAN ON EATING  I THOUGHT I HADBECOME DEAF FOR THE NOISES OF MOVEMENT I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HEARFROM THE PIT HAD CEASED ABSOLUTELY  I DID NOT FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TOCRAWL NOISELESSLY TO THE PEEPHOLE OR I WOULD HAVE GONE THEREON THE TWELFTH DAY MY THROAT WAS SO PAINFUL THAT TAKING THE CHANCEOF ALARMING THE MARTIANS I ATTACKED THE CREAKING RAINWATER PUMP THATSTOOD BY THE SINK AND GOT A COUPLE OF GLASSFULS OF BLACKENED ANDTAINTED RAIN WATER  I WAS GREATLY REFRESHED BY THIS AND EMBOLDENEDBY THE FACT THAT NO ENQUIRING TENTACLE FOLLOWED THE NOISE OF MYPUMPINGDURING THESE DAYS IN A RAMBLING INCONCLUSIVE WAY I THOUGHT MUCHOF THE CURATE AND OF THE MANNER OF HIS DEATHON THE THIRTEENTH DAY I DRANK SOME MORE WATER AND DOZED ANDTHOUGHT DISJOINTEDLY OF EATING AND OF VAGUE IMPOSSIBLE PLANS OFESCAPE  WHENEVER I DOZED I DREAMT OF HORRIBLE PHANTASMS OF THE DEATHOF THE CURATE OR OF SUMPTUOUS DINNERS BUT ASLEEP OR AWAKE I FELT AKEEN PAIN THAT URGED ME TO DRINK AGAIN AND AGAIN  THE LIGHT THAT CAMEINTO THE SCULLERY WAS NO LONGER GREY BUT RED  TO MY DISORDEREDIMAGINATION IT SEEMED THE COLOUR OF BLOODON THE FOURTEENTH DAY I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND I WAS SURPRISEDTO FIND THAT THE FRONDS OF THE RED WEED HAD GROWN RIGHT ACROSSTHE HOLE IN THE WALL TURNING THE HALFLIGHT OF THE PLACE INTO ACRIMSONCOLOURED OBSCURITYIT WAS EARLY ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY THAT I HEARD A CURIOUS FAMILIARSEQUENCE OF SOUNDS IN THE KITCHEN AND LISTENING IDENTIFIED IT ASTHE SNUFFING AND SCRATCHING OF A DOG  GOING INTO THE KITCHEN I SAW ADOGS NOSE PEERING IN THROUGH A BREAK AMONG THE RUDDY FRONDS  THISGREATLY SURPRISED ME  AT THE SCENT OF ME HE BARKED SHORTLYI THOUGHT IF I COULD INDUCE HIM TO COME INTO THE PLACE QUIETLY ISHOULD BE ABLE PERHAPS TO KILL AND EAT HIM AND IN ANY CASE ITWOULD BE ADVISABLE TO KILL HIM LEST HIS ACTIONS ATTRACTED THEATTENTION OF THE MARTIANSI CREPT FORWARD SAYING GOOD DOG VERY SOFTLY BUT HE SUDDENLYWITHDREW HIS HEAD AND DISAPPEAREDI LISTENEDI WAS NOT DEAFBUT CERTAINLY THE PIT WAS STILL  IHEARD A SOUND LIKE THE FLUTTER OF A BIRDS WINGS AND A HOARSECROAKING BUT THAT WAS ALLFOR A LONG WHILE I LAY CLOSE TO THE PEEPHOLE BUT NOT DARING TOMOVE ASIDE THE RED PLANTS THAT OBSCURED IT  ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD AFAINT PITTERPATTER LIKE THE FEET OF THE DOG GOING HITHER AND THITHERON THE SAND FAR BELOW ME AND THERE WERE MORE BIRDLIKE SOUNDS BUTTHAT WAS ALL  AT LENGTH ENCOURAGED BY THE SILENCE I LOOKED OUTEXCEPT IN THE CORNER WHERE A MULTITUDE OF CROWS HOPPED AND FOUGHTOVER THE SKELETONS OF THE DEAD THE MARTIANS HAD CONSUMED THERE WASNOT A LIVING THING IN THE PITI STARED ABOUT ME SCARCELY BELIEVING MY EYES  ALL THE MACHINERYHAD GONE  SAVE FOR THE BIG MOUND OF GREYISHBLUE POWDER IN ONECORNER CERTAIN BARS OF ALUMINIUM IN ANOTHER THE BLACK BIRDS AND THESKELETONS OF THE KILLED THE PLACE WAS MERELY AN EMPTY CIRCULAR PIT INTHE SANDSLOWLY I THRUST MYSELF OUT THROUGH THE RED WEED AND STOOD UPON THEMOUND OF RUBBLE  I COULD SEE IN ANY DIRECTION SAVE BEHIND ME TO THENORTH AND NEITHER MARTIANS NOR SIGN OF MARTIANS WERE TO BE SEEN  THEPIT DROPPED SHEERLY FROM MY FEET BUT A LITTLE WAY ALONG THE RUBBISHAFFORDED A PRACTICABLE SLOPE TO THE SUMMIT OF THE RUINS  MY CHANCE OFESCAPE HAD COME  I BEGAN TO TREMBLEI HESITATED FOR SOME TIME AND THEN IN A GUST OF DESPERATERESOLUTION AND WITH A HEART THAT THROBBED VIOLENTLY I SCRAMBLED TOTHE TOP OF THE MOUND IN WHICH I HAD BEEN BURIED SO LONGI LOOKED ABOUT AGAIN  TO THE NORTHWARD TOO NO MARTIAN WASVISIBLEWHEN I HAD LAST SEEN THIS PART OF SHEEN IN THE DAYLIGHT IT HAD BEENA STRAGGLING STREET OF COMFORTABLE WHITE AND RED HOUSES INTERSPERSEDWITH ABUNDANT SHADY TREES  NOW I STOOD ON A MOUND OF SMASHEDBRICKWORK CLAY AND GRAVEL OVER WHICH SPREAD A MULTITUDE OF REDCACTUSSHAPED PLANTS KNEEHIGH WITHOUT A SOLITARY TERRESTRIAL GROWTHTO DISPUTE THEIR FOOTING  THE TREES NEAR ME WERE DEAD AND BROWN BUTFURTHER A NETWORK OF RED THREAD SCALED THE STILL LIVING STEMSTHE NEIGHBOURING HOUSES HAD ALL BEEN WRECKED BUT NONE HAD BEENBURNED THEIR WALLS STOOD SOMETIMES TO THE SECOND STORY WITH SMASHEDWINDOWS AND SHATTERED DOORS  THE RED WEED GREW TUMULTUOUSLY IN THEIRROOFLESS ROOMS  BELOW ME WAS THE GREAT PIT WITH THE CROWS STRUGGLINGFOR ITS REFUSE  A NUMBER OF OTHER BIRDS HOPPED ABOUT AMONG THE RUINSFAR AWAY I SAW A GAUNT CAT SLINK CROUCHINGLY ALONG A WALL BUT TRACESOF MEN THERE WERE NONETHE DAY SEEMED BY CONTRAST WITH MY RECENT CONFINEMENT DAZZLINGLYBRIGHT THE SKY A GLOWING BLUE  A GENTLE BREEZE KEPT THE RED WEEDTHAT COVERED EVERY SCRAP OF UNOCCUPIED GROUND GENTLY SWAYING  AND OHTHE SWEETNESS OF THE AIRCHAPTER SIXTHE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYSFOR SOME TIME I STOOD TOTTERING ON THE MOUND REGARDLESS OF MYSAFETY  WITHIN THAT NOISOME DEN FROM WHICH I HAD EMERGED I HADTHOUGHT WITH A NARROW INTENSITY ONLY OF OUR IMMEDIATE SECURITY  I HADNOT REALISED WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING TO THE WORLD HAD NOT ANTICIPATEDTHIS STARTLING VISION OF UNFAMILIAR THINGS  I HAD EXPECTED TO SEESHEEN IN RUINSI FOUND ABOUT ME THE LANDSCAPE WEIRD AND LURID OFANOTHER PLANETFOR THAT MOMENT I TOUCHED AN EMOTION BEYOND THE COMMON RANGE OFMEN YET ONE THAT THE POOR BRUTES WE DOMINATE KNOW ONLY TOO WELL  IFELT AS A RABBIT MIGHT FEEL RETURNING TO HIS BURROW AND SUDDENLYCONFRONTED BY THE WORK OF A DOZEN BUSY NAVVIES DIGGING THE FOUNDATIONSOF A HOUSE  I FELT THE FIRST INKLING OF A THING THAT PRESENTLY GREWQUITE CLEAR IN MY MIND THAT OPPRESSED ME FOR MANY DAYS A SENSE OFDETHRONEMENT A PERSUASION THAT I WAS NO LONGER A MASTER BUT ANANIMAL AMONG THE ANIMALS UNDER THE MARTIAN HEEL  WITH US IT WOULD BEAS WITH THEM TO LURK AND WATCH TO RUN AND HIDE THE FEAR AND EMPIREOF MAN HAD PASSED AWAYBUT SO SOON AS THIS STRANGENESS HAD BEEN REALISED IT PASSED AND MYDOMINANT MOTIVE BECAME THE HUNGER OF MY LONG AND DISMAL FAST  IN THEDIRECTION AWAY FROM THE PIT I SAW BEYOND A REDCOVERED WALL A PATCHOF GARDEN GROUND UNBURIED  THIS GAVE ME A HINT AND I WENT KNEEDEEPAND SOMETIMES NECKDEEP IN THE RED WEED  THE DENSITY OF THEWEED GAVE ME A REASSURING SENSE OF HIDING  THE WALL WAS SOME SIX FEETHIGH AND WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CLAMBER IT I FOUND I COULD NOT LIFT MYFEET TO THE CREST  SO I WENT ALONG BY THE SIDE OF IT AND CAME TO ACORNER AND A ROCKWORK THAT ENABLED ME TO GET TO THE TOP AND TUMBLEINTO THE GARDEN I COVETED  HERE I FOUND SOME YOUNG ONIONS A COUPLEOF GLADIOLUS BULBS AND A QUANTITY OF IMMATURE CARROTS ALL OF WHICH ISECURED AND SCRAMBLING OVER A RUINED WALL WENT ON MY WAY THROUGHSCARLET AND CRIMSON TREES TOWARDS KEWIT WAS LIKE WALKING THROUGH ANAVENUE OF GIGANTIC BLOOD DROPSPOSSESSED WITH TWO IDEAS TO GET MOREFOOD AND TO LIMP AS SOON AND AS FAR AS MY STRENGTH PERMITTED OUT OFTHIS ACCURSED UNEARTHLY REGION OF THE PITSOME WAY FARTHER IN A GRASSY PLACE WAS A GROUP OF MUSHROOMS WHICHALSO I DEVOURED AND THEN I CAME UPON A BROWN SHEET OF FLOWING SHALLOWWATER WHERE MEADOWS USED TO BE  THESE FRAGMENTS OF NOURISHMENT SERVEDONLY TO WHET MY HUNGER  AT FIRST I WAS SURPRISED AT THIS FLOOD IN AHOT DRY SUMMER BUT AFTERWARDS I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY THETROPICAL EXUBERANCE OF THE RED WEED  DIRECTLY THIS EXTRAORDINARYGROWTH ENCOUNTERED WATER IT STRAIGHTWAY BECAME GIGANTIC AND OFUNPARALLELED FECUNDITY  ITS SEEDS WERE SIMPLY POURED DOWN INTO THEWATER OF THE WEY AND THAMES AND ITS SWIFTLY GROWING AND TITANIC WATERFRONDS SPEEDILY CHOKED BOTH THOSE RIVERSAT PUTNEY AS I AFTERWARDS SAW THE BRIDGE WAS ALMOST LOST IN ATANGLE OF THIS WEED AND AT RICHMOND TOO THE THAMES WATER POURED INA BROAD AND SHALLOW STREAM ACROSS THE MEADOWS OF HAMPTON ANDTWICKENHAM  AS THE WATER SPREAD THE WEED FOLLOWED THEM UNTIL THERUINED VILLAS OF THE THAMES VALLEY WERE FOR A TIME LOST IN THIS REDSWAMP WHOSE MARGIN I EXPLORED AND MUCH OF THE DESOLATION THEMARTIANS HAD CAUSED WAS CONCEALEDIN THE END THE RED WEED SUCCUMBED ALMOST AS QUICKLY AS IT HADSPREAD  A CANKERING DISEASE DUE IT IS BELIEVED TO THE ACTION OFCERTAIN BACTERIA PRESENTLY SEIZED UPON IT  NOW BY THE ACTION OFNATURAL SELECTION ALL TERRESTRIAL PLANTS HAVE ACQUIRED A RESISTINGPOWER AGAINST BACTERIAL DISEASESTHEY NEVER SUCCUMB WITHOUT A SEVERESTRUGGLE BUT THE RED WEED ROTTED LIKE A THING ALREADY DEAD  THEFRONDS BECAME BLEACHED AND THEN SHRIVELLED AND BRITTLE  THEY BROKEOFF AT THE LEAST TOUCH AND THE WATERS THAT HAD STIMULATED THEIR EARLYGROWTH CARRIED THEIR LAST VESTIGES OUT TO SEAMY FIRST ACT ON COMING TO THIS WATER WAS OF COURSE TO SLAKE MYTHIRST  I DRANK A GREAT DEAL OF IT AND MOVED BY AN IMPULSE GNAWEDSOME FRONDS OF RED WEED BUT THEY WERE WATERY AND HAD A SICKLYMETALLIC TASTE  I FOUND THE WATER WAS SUFFICIENTLY SHALLOW FOR ME TOWADE SECURELY ALTHOUGH THE RED WEED IMPEDED MY FEET A LITTLE BUT THEFLOOD EVIDENTLY GOT DEEPER TOWARDS THE RIVER AND I TURNED BACK TOMORTLAKE  I MANAGED TO MAKE OUT THE ROAD BY MEANS OF OCCASIONAL RUINSOF ITS VILLAS AND FENCES AND LAMPS AND SO PRESENTLY I GOT OUT OF THISSPATE AND MADE MY WAY TO THE HILL GOING UP TOWARDS ROEHAMPTON AND CAMEOUT ON PUTNEY COMMONHERE THE SCENERY CHANGED FROM THE STRANGE AND UNFAMILIAR TO THEWRECKAGE OF THE FAMILIAR PATCHES OF GROUND EXHIBITED THE DEVASTATIONOF A CYCLONE AND IN A FEW SCORE YARDS I WOULD COME UPON PERFECTLYUNDISTURBED SPACES HOUSES WITH THEIR BLINDS TRIMLY DRAWN AND DOORSCLOSED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN LEFT FOR A DAY BY THE OWNERS OR AS IFTHEIR INHABITANTS SLEPT WITHIN  THE RED WEED WAS LESS ABUNDANT THETALL TREES ALONG THE LANE WERE FREE FROM THE RED CREEPER  I HUNTEDFOR FOOD AMONG THE TREES FINDING NOTHING AND I ALSO RAIDED A COUPLEOF SILENT HOUSES BUT THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN BROKEN INTO AND RANSACKEDI RESTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAYLIGHT IN A SHRUBBERY BEING INMY ENFEEBLED CONDITION TOO FATIGUED TO PUSH ONALL THIS TIME I SAW NO HUMAN BEINGS AND NO SIGNS OF THE MARTIANSI ENCOUNTERED A COUPLE OF HUNGRYLOOKING DOGS BUT BOTH HURRIEDCIRCUITOUSLY AWAY FROM THE ADVANCES I MADE THEM  NEAR ROEHAMPTON IHAD SEEN TWO HUMAN SKELETONSNOT BODIES BUT SKELETONS PICKEDCLEANAND IN THE WOOD BY ME I FOUND THE CRUSHED AND SCATTERED BONESOF SEVERAL CATS AND RABBITS AND THE SKULL OF A SHEEP  BUT THOUGH IGNAWED PARTS OF THESE IN MY MOUTH THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GOT FROMTHEMAFTER SUNSET I STRUGGLED ON ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS PUTNEY WHERE ITHINK THE HEATRAY MUST HAVE BEEN USED FOR SOME REASON  AND IN THEGARDEN BEYOND ROEHAMPTON I GOT A QUANTITY OF IMMATURE POTATOESSUFFICIENT TO STAY MY HUNGER  FROM THIS GARDEN ONE LOOKED DOWN UPONPUTNEY AND THE RIVER  THE ASPECT OF THE PLACE IN THE DUSK WASSINGULARLY DESOLATE BLACKENED TREES BLACKENED DESOLATE RUINS ANDDOWN THE HILL THE SHEETS OF THE FLOODED RIVER REDTINGED WITH THEWEED  AND OVER ALLSILENCE  IT FILLED ME WITH INDESCRIBABLE TERRORTO THINK HOW SWIFTLY THAT DESOLATING CHANGE HAD COMEFOR A TIME I BELIEVED THAT MANKIND HAD BEEN SWEPT OUT OF EXISTENCEAND THAT I STOOD THERE ALONE THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE  HARD BY THETOP OF PUTNEY HILL I CAME UPON ANOTHER SKELETON WITH THE ARMSDISLOCATED AND REMOVED SEVERAL YARDS FROM THE REST OF THE BODY  AS IPROCEEDED I BECAME MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT THE EXTERMINATION OFMANKIND WAS SAVE FOR SUCH STRAGGLERS AS MYSELF ALREADY ACCOMPLISHEDIN THIS PART OF THE WORLD  THE MARTIANS I THOUGHT HAD GONE ON ANDLEFT THE COUNTRY DESOLATED SEEKING FOOD ELSEWHERE  PERHAPS EVEN NOWTHEY WERE DESTROYING BERLIN OR PARIS OR IT MIGHT BE THEY HAD GONENORTHWARDCHAPTER SEVENTHE MAN ON PUTNEY HILLI SPENT THAT NIGHT IN THE INN THAT STANDS AT THE TOP OF PUTNEYHILL SLEEPING IN A MADE BED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MY FLIGHT TOLEATHERHEAD  I WILL NOT TELL THE NEEDLESS

CONSECUTIVELYATHING I DO NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE DONE SINCE MY LAST ARGUMENT WITH THECURATE  DURING ALL THE INTERVENING TIME MY MENTAL CONDITION HAD BEENA HURRYING SUCCESSION OF VAGUE EMOTIONAL STATES OR A SORT OF STUPIDRECEPTIVITY  BUT IN THE NIGHT MY BRAIN REINFORCED I SUPPOSE BY THEFOOD I HAD EATEN GREW CLEAR AGAIN AND I THOUGHTTHREE THINGS STRUGGLED FOR POSSESSION OF MY MIND THE KILLING OFTHE CURATE THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE MARTIANS AND THE POSSIBLE FATE OFMY WIFE  THE FORMER GAVE ME NO SENSATION OF HORROR OR REMORSE TORECALL I SAW IT SIMPLY AS A THING DONE A MEMORY INFINITELYDISAGREEABLE

LAST UPON REGENTS PARK  AND AS IEMERGED FROM THE TOP OF BAKER STREET I SAW FAR AWAY OVER THE TREES INTHE CLEARNESS OF THE SUNSET THE HOOD OF THE MARTIAN GIANT FROM WHICHTHIS HOWLING PROCEEDED  I WAS NOT TERRIFIED  I CAME UPON HIM AS IFIT WERE A MATTER OF COURSE  I WATCHED HIM FOR SOME TIME BUT HE DIDNOT MOVE  HE APPEARED TO BE STANDING AND YELLING FOR NO REASON THATI COULD DISCOVERI TRIED TO FORMULATE A PLAN OF ACTION  THAT PERPETUAL SOUND OFULLA ULLA ULLA ULLA CONFUSED MY MIND  PERHAPS I WAS TOO TIREDTO BE VERY FEARFUL  CERTAINLY I WAS MORE CURIOUS TO KNOW THE REASONOF THIS MONOTONOUS CRYING THAN AFRAID  I TURNED BACK AWAY FROM THEPARK AND STRUCK INTO PARK ROAD INTENDING TO SKIRT THE PARK WENTALONG UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE TERRACES AND GOT A VIEW OF THISSTATIONARY HOWLING MARTIAN FROM THE DIRECTION OF ST JOHNS WOOD  ACOUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS OUT OF BAKER STREET I HEARD A YELPING CHORUSAND SAW FIRST A DOG WITH A PIECE OF PUTRESCENT RED MEAT IN HIS JAWSCOMING HEADLONG TOWARDS ME AND THEN A PACK OF STARVING MONGRELS INPURSUIT OF HIM  HE MADE A WIDE CURVE TO AVOID ME AS THOUGH HE FEAREDI MIGHT PROVE A FRESH COMPETITOR  AS THE YELPING DIED AWAY DOWN THESILENT ROAD THE WAILING SOUND OF ULLA ULLA ULLA ULLA REASSERTEDITSELFI CAME UPON THE WRECKED HANDLINGMACHINE HALFWAY TO ST JOHNS WOODSTATION  AT FIRST I THOUGHT A HOUSE HAD FALLEN ACROSS THE ROAD  ITWAS ONLY AS I CLAMBERED AMONG THE RUINS THAT I SAW WITH A START THISMECHANICAL SAMSON LYING WITH ITS TENTACLES BENT AND SMASHED ANDTWISTED AMONG THE RUINS IT HAD MADE  THE FOREPART WAS SHATTERED  ITSEEMED AS IF IT HAD DRIVEN BLINDLY STRAIGHT AT THE HOUSE AND HAD BEENOVERWHELMED IN ITS OVERTHROW  IT SEEMED TO ME THEN THAT THIS MIGHTHAVE HAPPENED BY A HANDLINGMACHINE ESCAPING FROM THE GUIDANCE OF ITSMARTIAN  I COULD NOT CLAMBER AMONG THE RUINS TO SEE IT AND THETWILIGHT WAS NOW SO FAR ADVANCED THAT THE BLOOD WITH WHICH ITS SEATWAS SMEARED AND THE GNAWED GRISTLE OF THE MARTIAN THAT THE DOGS HADLEFT WERE INVISIBLE TO MEWONDERING STILL MORE AT ALL THAT I HAD SEEN I PUSHED ON TOWARDSPRIMROSE HILL  FAR AWAY THROUGH A GAP IN THE TREES I SAW A SECONDMARTIAN AS MOTIONLESS AS THE FIRST STANDING IN THE PARK TOWARDS THEZOOLOGICAL GARDENS AND SILENT  A LITTLE BEYOND THE RUINS ABOUT THESMASHED HANDLINGMACHINE I CAME UPON THE RED WEED AGAIN AND FOUND THEREGENTS CANAL A SPONGY MASS OF DARKRED VEGETATIONAS I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE SOUND OF ULLA ULLA ULLA ULLACEASED  IT WAS AS IT WERE CUT OFF  THE SILENCE CAME LIKE ATHUNDERCLAPTHE DUSKY HOUSES ABOUT ME STOOD FAINT AND TALL AND DIM THE TREESTOWARDS THE PARK WERE

ICOULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO GO ON  I TURNED DOWN ST JOHNS WOOD ROADAND RAN HEADLONG FROM THIS UNENDURABLE STILLNESS TOWARDS KILBURN  IHID FROM THE NIGHT AND THE SILENCE UNTIL LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT IN ACABMENS SHELTER IN HARROW ROAD  BUT BEFORE THE DAWN MY COURAGERETURNED AND WHILE THE STARS WERE STILL IN THE SKY I TURNED ONCE MORETOWARDS REGENTS PARK  I MISSED MY WAY AMONG THE STREETS ANDPRESENTLY SAW DOWN A LONG AVENUE IN THE HALFLIGHT OF THE EARLY DAWNTHE CURVE OF PRIMROSE HILL  ON THE SUMMIT TOWERING UP TO THE FADINGSTARS WAS A THIRD MARTIAN ERECT AND MOTIONLESS LIKE THE OTHERSAN INSANE RESOLVE POSSESSED ME  I WOULD DIE AND END IT  AND IWOULD SAVE MYSELF EVEN THE TROUBLE OF KILLING MYSELF  I MARCHED ONRECKLESSLY TOWARDS THIS TITAN AND THEN AS I DREW NEARER AND THELIGHT GREW I SAW

SO CAME HOME PAST THE COLLEGE ARMS  A MAN STANDING AT ANOPEN COTTAGE DOOR GREETED ME BY NAME AS I PASSEDI LOOKED AT MY HOUSE WITH A QUICK FLASH OF HOPE THAT FADEDIMMEDIATELY  THE DOOR HAD BEEN FORCED IT WAS UNFAST AND WAS OPENINGSLOWLY AS I APPROACHEDIT SLAMMED AGAIN  THE CURTAINS OF MY STUDY FLUTTERED OUT OF THEOPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD WATCHED THE DAWN  NOONE HAD CLOSED IT SINCE  THE SMASHED BUSHES WERE JUST AS I HAD LEFTTHEM NEARLY FOUR WEEKS AGO  I STUMBLED INTO THE HALL AND THE HOUSEFELT EMPTY  THE STAIR CARPET WAS RUFFLED AND DISCOLOURED WHERE I HADCROUCHED SOAKED TO THE SKIN FROM THE THUNDERSTORM THE NIGHT OF THECATASTROPHE  OUR MUDDY FOOTSTEPS I SAW STILL WENT UP THE STAIRSI FOLLOWED THEM TO MY STUDY AND FOUND LYING ON MY WRITINGTABLESTILL WITH THE SELENITE PAPER WEIGHT UPON IT THE SHEET OF WORK I HADLEFT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE OPENING OF THE CYLINDER  FOR A SPACE ISTOOD READING OVER MY ABANDONED ARGUMENTS  IT WAS A PAPER ON THEPROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL IDEAS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THECIVILISING PROCESS AND THE LAST SENTENCE WAS THE OPENING OF APROPHECY IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS I HAD WRITTEN WE MAYEXPECT  THE SENTENCE ENDED ABRUPTLY  I REMEMBERED MY INABILITYTO FIX MY MIND THAT MORNING SCARCELY A MONTH GONE BY AND HOW I HADBROKEN OFF TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE FROM THE NEWSBOY  I REMEMBEREDHOW I WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN GATE AS HE CAME ALONG AND HOW I HADLISTENED TO HIS ODD STORY OF MEN FROM MARSI CAME DOWN AND WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM  THERE WERE THE MUTTONAND THE BREAD BOTH FAR GONE NOW IN DECAY AND A BEER BOTTLEOVERTURNED JUST AS I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD LEFT THEM  MY HOME WASDESOLATE  I PERCEIVED THE FOLLY OF THE FAINT HOPE I HAD CHERISHED SOLONG  AND THEN A STRANGE THING OCCURRED  IT IS NO USE SAID AVOICE  THE HOUSE IS DESERTED  NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE THESE TEN DAYSDO NOT STAY HERE TO TORMENT YOURSELF  NO ONE ESCAPED BUT YOUI WAS STARTLED  HAD I SPOKEN MY THOUGHT ALOUD  I TURNED AND THEFRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME  I MADE A STEP TO IT AND STOODLOOKING OUTAND THERE AMAZED AND AFRAID EVEN AS I STOOD AMAZED AND AFRAIDWERE MY COUSIN AND MY WIFEMY WIFE WHITE AND TEARLESS  SHE GAVE AFAINT CRYI CAME SHE SAID  I KNEWKNEWSHE PUT HER HAND TO HER THROATSWAYED  I MADE A STEP FORWARD ANDCAUGHT HER IN MY ARMSCHAPTER TENTHE EPILOGUEI CANNOT BUT REGRET NOW THAT I AM CONCLUDING MY STORY HOW LITTLEI AM ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE MANY DEBATABLEQUESTIONS WHICH ARE STILL UNSETTLED  IN ONE RESPECT I SHALL CERTAINLYPROVOKE CRITICISM  MY PARTICULAR PROVINCE IS SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHYMY KNOWLEDGE OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY IS CONFINED TO A BOOK OR TWOBUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CARVERS SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE REASON OF THERAPID DEATH OF THE MARTIANS IS SO PROBABLE AS TO BE REGARDED ALMOST ASA PROVEN CONCLUSION  I HAVE ASSUMED THAT IN THE BODY OF MY NARRATIVEAT ANY RATE IN ALL THE BODIES OF THE MARTIANS THAT WERE EXAMINEDAFTER THE WAR NO BACTERIA EXCEPT THOSE ALREADY KNOWN AS TERRESTRIALSPECIES WERE FOUND  THAT THEY DID NOT BURY ANY OF THEIR DEAD AND THERECKLESS SLAUGHTER THEY PERPETRATED POINT ALSO TO AN ENTIRE IGNORANCEOF THE PUTREFACTIVE PROCESS  BUT PROBABLE AS THIS SEEMS IT IS BY NOMEANS A PROVEN CONCLUSIONNEITHER IS THE COMPOSITION OF THE BLACK SMOKE KNOWN WHICH THEMARTIANS USED WITH SUCH DEADLY EFFECT AND THE GENERATOR OF THEHEATRAYS REMAINS A PUZZLE  THE TERRIBLE DISASTERS AT THE EALINGAND SOUTH KENSINGTON LABORATORIES HAVE DISINCLINED ANALYSTS FOR FURTHERINVESTIGATIONS UPON THE LATTER  SPECTRUM ANALYSIS OF THE BLACK POWDERPOINTS UNMISTAKABLY TO THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN ELEMENT WITH ABRILLIANT GROUP OF THREE LINES IN THE GREEN AND IT IS POSSIBLE THATIT COMBINES WITH ARGON TO FORM A COMPOUND WHICH ACTS AT ONCE WITHDEADLY EFFECT UPON SOME CONSTITUENT IN THE BLOOD  BUT SUCH UNPROVENSPECULATIONS WILL SCARCELY BE OF INTEREST TO THE GENERAL READER TOWHOM THIS STORY IS ADDRESSED  NONE OF THE BROWN SCUM THAT DRIFTEDDOWN THE THAMES AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF SHEPPERTON WAS EXAMINED ATTHE TIME AND NOW NONE IS FORTHCOMINGTHE RESULTS OF AN ANATOMICAL EXAMINATION OF THE MARTIANS SO FARAS THE PROWLING DOGS HAD LEFT SUCH AN EXAMINATION POSSIBLE I HAVEALREADY GIVEN  BUT EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE MAGNIFICENT ANDALMOST COMPLETE SPECIMEN IN SPIRITS AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM ANDTHE COUNTLESS DRAWINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE FROM IT AND BEYOND THATTHE INTEREST OF THEIR PHYSIOLOGY AND STRUCTURE IS PURELY SCIENTIFICA QUESTION OF GRAVER AND UNIVERSAL INTEREST IS THE POSSIBILITY OFANOTHER ATTACK FROM THE MARTIANS  I DO NOT THINK THAT NEARLY ENOUGHATTENTION IS BEING GIVEN TO THIS ASPECT OF THE MATTER  AT PRESENT THEPLANET MARS IS IN CONJUNCTION BUT WITH EVERY RETURN TO OPPOSITION IFOR ONE ANTICIPATE A RENEWAL OF THEIR ADVENTURE  IN ANY CASE WESHOULD BE PREPARED  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TODEFINE THE POSITION OF THE GUN FROM WHICH THE SHOTS ARE DISCHARGED TOKEEP A SUSTAINED WATCH UPON THIS PART OF THE PLANET AND TO ANTICIPATETHE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT ATTACKIN THAT CASE THE CYLINDER MIGHT BE DESTROYED WITH DYNAMITE ORARTILLERY BEFORE IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COOL FOR THE MARTIANS TO EMERGEOR THEY MIGHT BE BUTCHERED BY MEANS OF GUNS SO SOON AS THE SCREWOPENED  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE LOST A VAST ADVANTAGE IN THEFAILURE OF THEIR FIRST SURPRISE  POSSIBLY THEY SEE IT IN THE SAMELIGHTLESSING HAS ADVANCED EXCELLENT REASONS FOR SUPPOSING THAT THEMARTIANS HAVE ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN EFFECTING A LANDING ON THE PLANETVENUS  SEVEN MONTHS AGO NOW VENUS AND MARS WERE IN ALIGNMENT WITHTHE SUN THAT IS TO SAY MARS WAS IN OPPOSITION FROM THE POINT OF VIEWOF AN OBSERVER ON VENUS  SUBSEQUENTLY A PECULIAR LUMINOUS AND SINUOUSMARKING APPEARED ON THE UNILLUMINED HALF OF THE INNER PLANET ANDALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY A FAINT DARK MARK OF A SIMILAR SINUOUS CHARACTERWAS DETECTED UPON A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MARTIAN DISK  ONE NEEDS TO SEETHE DRAWINGS OF THESE APPEARANCES IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE FULLY THEIRREMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE IN CHARACTERAT ANY RATE WHETHER WE EXPECT ANOTHER INVASION OR NOT OUR VIEWSOF THE HUMAN FUTURE MUST BE GREATLY MODIFIED BY THESE EVENTS  WE HAVELEARNED NOW THAT WE CANNOT REGARD THIS PLANET AS BEING FENCED IN AND ASECURE ABIDING PLACE FOR MAN WE CAN NEVER ANTICIPATE THE UNSEEN GOODOR EVIL THAT MAY COME UPON US SUDDENLY OUT OF SPACE  IT MAY BE THATIN THE LARGER DESIGN OF THE UNIVERSE THIS INVASION FROM MARS IS NOTWITHOUT ITS ULTIMATE BENEFIT FOR MEN IT HAS ROBBED US OF THAT SERENECONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE WHICH IS THE MOST FRUITFUL SOURCE OFDECADENCE THE GIFTS TO HUMAN SCIENCE IT HAS BROUGHT ARE ENORMOUS ANDIT HAS DONE MUCH TO PROMOTE THE CONCEPTION OF THE COMMONWEAL OFMANKIND  IT MAY BE THAT ACROSS THE IMMENSITY OF SPACE THE MARTIANSHAVE WATCHED THE FATE OF THESE PIONEERS OF THEIRS AND LEARNED THEIRLESSON AND THAT ON THE PLANET VENUS THEY HAVE FOUND A SECURERSETTLEMENT  BE THAT AS IT MAY FOR MANY YEARS YET THERE WILLCERTAINLY BE NO RELAXATION OF THE EAGER SCRUTINY OF THE MARTIAN DISKAND THOSE FIERY DARTS OF THE SKY THE SHOOTING STARS WILL BRING WITHTHEM AS THEY FALL AN UNAVOIDABLE APPREHENSION TO ALL THE SONS OF MENTHE BROADENING OF MENS VIEWS THAT HAS RESULTED CAN SCARCELY BEEXAGGERATED  BEFORE THE CYLINDER FELL THERE WAS A GENERAL PERSUASIONTHAT THROUGH ALL THE DEEP OF SPACE NO LIFE EXISTED BEYOND THE PETTYSURFACE OF OUR MINUTE SPHERE  NOW WE SEE FURTHER  IF THE MARTIANSCAN REACH VENUS THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THE THING ISIMPOSSIBLE FOR MEN AND WHEN THE SLOW COOLING OF THE SUN MAKES THISEARTH UNINHABITABLE AS AT LAST IT MUST DO IT MAY BE THAT THE THREADOF LIFE THAT HAS BEGUN HERE WILL HAVE STREAMED OUT AND CAUGHT OURSISTER PLANET WITHIN ITS TOILSDIM AND WONDERFUL IS THE VISION I HAVE CONJURED UP IN MY MIND OFLIFE SPREADING SLOWLY FROM THIS LITTLE SEED BED OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMTHROUGHOUT THE INANIMATE VASTNESS OF SIDEREAL SPACE  BUT THAT IS AREMOTE DREAM  IT MAY BE ON THE OTHER HAND THAT THE DESTRUCTION OFTHE MARTIANS IS ONLY A REPRIEVE  TO THEM AND NOT TO US PERHAPS ISTHE FUTURE ORDAINEDI MUST CONFESS THE STRESS AND DANGER OF THE TIME HAVE LEFT ANABIDING SENSE OF DOUBT AND INSECURITY IN MY MIND  I SIT IN MY STUDYWRITING BY LAMPLIGHT AND SUDDENLY I SEE AGAIN THE HEALING VALLEYBELOW SET WITH WRITHING FLAMES AND FEEL THE HOUSE BEHIND AND ABOUT MEEMPTY AND DESOLATE  I GO OUT INTO THE BYFLEET ROAD AND VEHICLES PASSME A BUTCHER BOY IN A CART A CABFUL OF VISITORS A WORKMAN ON ABICYCLE CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL AND SUDDENLY THEY BECOME VAGUE ANDUNREAL AND I HURRY AGAIN WITH THE ARTILLERYMAN THROUGH THE HOTBROODING SILENCE  OF A NIGHT I SEE THE BLACK POWDER DARKENING THESILENT STREETS AND THE CONTORTED BODIES SHROUDED IN THAT LAYER THEYRISE UPON ME TATTERED AND DOGBITTEN  THEY GIBBER AND GROW FIERCERPALER UGLIER MAD DISTORTIONS OF HUMANITY AT LAST AND I WAKE COLDAND WRETCHED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHTI GO TO LONDON AND SEE THE BUSY MULTITUDES IN FLEET STREET AND THESTRAND AND IT COMES ACROSS MY MIND THAT THEY ARE BUT THE GHOSTS OFTHE PAST HAUNTING THE STREETS THAT I HAVE SEEN SILENT AND WRETCHEDGOING TO AND FRO PHANTASMS IN A DEAD CITY THE MOCKERY OF LIFE IN AGALVANISED BODY  AND STRANGE TOO IT IS TO STAND ON PRIMROSE HILLAS I DID BUT A DAY BEFORE WRITING THIS LAST CHAPTER TO SEE THE GREATPROVINCE OF HOUSES DIM AND BLUE THROUGH THE HAZE OF THE SMOKE ANDMIST VANISHING AT LAST INTO THE VAGUE LOWER SKY TO SEE THE PEOPLEWALKING TO AND FRO AMONG THE FLOWER BEDS ON THE HILL TO SEE THESIGHTSEERS ABOUT THE MARTIAN MACHINE THAT STANDS THERE STILL TO HEARTHE TUMULT OF PLAYING CHILDREN AND TO RECALL THE TIME WHEN I SAW ITALL BRIGHT AND CLEARCUT HARD AND SILENT UNDER THE DAWN OF THAT LASTGREAT DAY   AND STRANGEST OF ALL IS IT TO HOLD MY WIFES HAND AGAIN AND TO THINKTHAT I HAVE COUNTED HER AND THAT SHE HAS COUNTED ME AMONG THE DEAD
