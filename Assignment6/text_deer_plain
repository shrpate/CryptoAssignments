DEER LIVE IN A VARIETY OF BIOMES RANGING FROM TUNDRA TO THE TROPICAL RAINFOREST WHILE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH FORESTS MANY DEER ARE ECOTONE SPECIES THAT LIVE IN TRANSITIONAL AREAS BETWEEN FORESTS AND THICKETS FOR COVER AND PRAIRIE AND SAVANNA OPEN SPACE THE MAJORITY OF LARGE DEER SPECIES INHABIT TEMPERATE MIXED DECIDUOUS FOREST MOUNTAIN MIXED CONIFEROUS FOREST TROPICAL SEASONALDRY FOREST AND SAVANNA HABITATS AROUND THE WORLD CLEARING OPEN AREAS WITHIN FORESTS TO SOME EXTENT MAY ACTUALLY BENEFIT DEER POPULATIONS BY EXPOSING THE UNDERSTORY AND ALLOWING THE TYPES OF GRASSES WEEDS AND HERBS TO GROW THAT DEER LIKE TO EAT ADDITIONALLY ACCESS TO ADJACENT CROPLANDS MAY ALSO BENEFIT DEER HOWEVER ADEQUATE FOREST OR BRUSH COVER MUST STILL BE PROVIDED FOR POPULATIONS TO GROW AND THRIVEDEER ARE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED WITH INDIGENOUS REPRESENTATIVES IN ALL CONTINENTS EXCEPT ANTARCTICA AND AUSTRALIA THOUGH AFRICA HAS ONLY ONE NATIVE DEER THE BARBARY STAG A SUBSPECIES OF RED DEER THAT IS CONFINED TO THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHWEST OF THE CONTINENT HOWEVER FALLOW DEER HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO SOUTH AFRICA SMALL SPECIES OF BROCKET DEER AND PUDS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA AND MUNTJACS OF ASIA GENERALLY OCCUPY DENSE FORESTS AND ARE LESS OFTEN SEEN IN OPEN SPACES WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE INDIAN MUNTJAC THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL SPECIES OF DEER THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED AND LIVE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN MOUNTAINS GRASSLANDS SWAMPS AND WET SAVANNAS OR RIPARIAN CORRIDORS SURROUNDED BY DESERTS SOME DEER HAVE A CIRCUMPOLAR DISTRIBUTION IN BOTH NORTH AMERICA AND EURASIA EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE CARIBOU THAT LIVE IN ARCTIC TUNDRA AND TAIGA BOREAL FORESTS AND MOOSE THAT INHABIT TAIGA AND ADJACENT AREAS HUEMUL DEER TARUCA AND CHILEAN HUEMUL OF SOUTH AMERICAS ANDES FILL THE ECOLOGICAL NICHES OF THE IBEX AND WILD GOAT WITH THE FAWNS BEHAVING MORE LIKE GOAT KIDSTHE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF LARGE DEER SPECIES IN TEMPERATE NORTH AMERICA LIES IN THE CANADIAN ROCKY MOUNTAIN AND COLUMBIA MOUNTAIN REGIONS BETWEEN ALBERTA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA WHERE ALL FIVE NORTH AMERICAN DEER SPECIES WHITETAILED DEER MULE DEER CARIBOU ELK AND MOOSE CAN BE FOUND THIS REGION HAS SEVERAL CLUSTERS OF NATIONAL PARKS INCLUDING MOUNT REVELSTOKE NATIONAL PARK GLACIER NATIONAL PARK CANADA YOHO NATIONAL PARK AND KOOTENAY NATIONAL PARK ON THE BRITISH COLUMBIA SIDE AND BANFF NATIONAL PARK JASPER NATIONAL PARK AND GLACIER NATIONAL PARK US ON THE ALBERTA AND MONTANA SIDES MOUNTAIN SLOPE HABITATS VARY FROM MOIST CONIFEROUSMIXED FORESTED HABITATS TO DRY SUBALPINEPINE FORESTS WITH ALPINE MEADOWS HIGHER UP THE FOOTHILLS AND RIVER VALLEYS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN RANGES PROVIDE A MOSAIC OF CROPLAND AND DECIDUOUS PARKLANDS THE RARE WOODLAND CARIBOU HAVE THE MOST RESTRICTED RANGE LIVING AT HIGHER ALTITUDES IN THE SUBALPINE MEADOWS AND ALPINE TUNDRA AREAS OF SOME OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGES ELK AND MULE DEER BOTH MIGRATE BETWEEN THE ALPINE MEADOWS AND LOWER CONIFEROUS FORESTS AND TEND TO BE MOST COMMON IN THIS REGION ELK ALSO INHABIT RIVER VALLEY BOTTOMLANDS WHICH THEY SHARE WITH WHITETAILED DEER THE WHITETAILED DEER HAVE RECENTLY EXPANDED THEIR RANGE WITHIN THE FOOTHILLS AND RIVER VALLEY BOTTOMS OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES OWING TO CONVERSION OF LAND TO CROPLAND AND THE CLEARING OF CONIFEROUS FORESTS ALLOWING MORE DECIDUOUS VEGETATION TO GROW UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES THEY ALSO LIVE IN THE ASPEN PARKLANDS NORTH OF CALGARY AND EDMONTON WHERE THEY SHARE HABITAT WITH THE MOOSE THE ADJACENT GREAT PLAINS GRASSLAND HABITATS ARE LEFT TO HERDS OF ELK AMERICAN BISON AND PRONGHORN ANTELOPEREINDEER HERDS STANDING ON SNOW TO AVOID FLIESTHE EURASIAN CONTINENT INCLUDING THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT BOASTS THE MOST SPECIES OF DEER IN THE WORLD WITH MOST SPECIES BEING FOUND IN ASIA EUROPE IN COMPARISON HAS LOWER DIVERSITY IN PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES HOWEVER MANY NATIONAL PARKS AND PROTECTED RESERVES IN EUROPE DO HAVE POPULATIONS OF RED DEER ROE DEER AND FALLOW DEER THESE SPECIES HAVE LONG BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE BUT ALSO INHABIT ASIA MINOR THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS AND NORTHWESTERN IRAN EUROPEAN FALLOW DEER HISTORICALLY LIVED OVER MUCH OF EUROPE DURING THE ICE AGES BUT AFTERWARDS BECAME RESTRICTED PRIMARILY TO THE ANATOLIAN PENINSULA IN PRESENTDAY TURKEYPRESENTDAY FALLOW DEER POPULATIONS IN EUROPE ARE A RESULT OF HISTORIC MANMADE INTRODUCTIONS OF THIS SPECIES FIRST TO THE MEDITERRANEAN REGIONS OF EUROPE THEN EVENTUALLY TO THE REST OF EUROPE THEY WERE INITIALLY PARK ANIMALS THAT LATER ESCAPED AND REESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN THE WILD HISTORICALLY EUROPES DEER SPECIES SHARED THEIR DECIDUOUS FOREST HABITAT WITH OTHER HERBIVORES SUCH AS THE EXTINCT TARPAN FOREST HORSE EXTINCT AUROCHS FOREST OX AND THE ENDANGERED WISENT EUROPEAN BISON GOOD PLACES TO SEE DEER IN EUROPE INCLUDE THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS THE AUSTRIAN ALPS THE WETLANDS BETWEEN AUSTRIA HUNGARY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND SOME FINE NATIONAL PARKS INCLUDING DOANA NATIONAL PARK IN SPAIN THE VELUWE IN THE NETHERLANDS THE ARDENNES IN BELGIUM AND BIAOWIEA NATIONAL PARK OF POLAND SPAIN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS STILL HAVE VIRGIN FOREST AREAS THAT ARE NOT ONLY HOME TO SIZABLE DEER POPULATIONS BUT ALSO FOR OTHER ANIMALS THAT WERE ONCE ABUNDANT SUCH AS THE WISENT EURASIAN LYNX IBERIAN LYNX WOLVES AND BROWN BEARSTHE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF LARGE DEER SPECIES IN TEMPERATE ASIA OCCURS IN THE MIXED DECIDUOUS FORESTS MOUNTAIN CONIFEROUS FORESTS AND TAIGA BORDERING NORTH KOREA MANCHURIA NORTHEASTERN CHINA AND THE USSURI REGION RUSSIA THESE ARE AMONG SOME OF THE RICHEST DECIDUOUS AND CONIFEROUS FORESTS IN THE WORLD WHERE ONE CAN FIND SIBERIAN ROE DEER SIKA DEER ELK AND MOOSE ASIAN CARIBOU OCCUPY THE NORTHERN FRINGES OF THIS REGION ALONG THE SINORUSSIAN BORDERDEER SUCH AS THE SIKA DEER THOROLDS DEER CENTRAL ASIAN RED DEER AND ELK HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FARMED FOR THEIR ANTLERS BY HAN CHINESE TURKIC PEOPLES TUNGUSIC PEOPLES MONGOLIANS AND KOREANS LIKE THE SAMI PEOPLE OF FINLAND AND SCANDINAVIA THE TUNGUSIC PEOPLES MONGOLIANS AND TURKIC PEOPLES OF SOUTHERN SIBERIA NORTHERN MONGOLIA AND THE USSURI REGION HAVE ALSO TAKEN TO RAISING SEMIDOMESTICATED

ENDANGERED BARASINGHA AND VERY COMMON CHITAL ARE GREGARIOUS AND LIVE IN LARGE HERDS INDIAN SAMBAR CAN BE GREGARIOUS BUT ARE USUALLY SOLITARY OR LIVE IN SMALLER HERDS HOG DEER ARE SOLITARY AND HAVE LOWER DENSITIES THAN INDIAN MUNTJAC DEER CAN BE SEEN IN SEVERAL NATIONAL PARKS IN INDIA NEPAL AND SRI LANKA OF WHICH KANHA NATIONAL PARK DUDHWA NATIONAL PARK AND CHITWAN NATIONAL PARK ARE MOST FAMOUS SRI LANKAS WILPATTU NATIONAL PARK AND YALA NATIONAL PARK HAVE LARGE HERDS OF INDIAN SAMBAR AND CHITAL THE INDIAN SAMBAR ARE MORE GREGARIOUS IN SRI LANKA THAN OTHER PARTS OF THEIR RANGE AND TEND TO

OF THESE SOUTH ASIAN AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN DEER SPECIES ALSO SHARE THEIR HABITAT WITH OTHER HERBIVORES SUCH AS ASIAN ELEPHANTS THE VARIOUS ASIAN RHINOCEROS SPECIES VARIOUS ANTELOPE SPECIES SUCH AS NILGAI FOURHORNED ANTELOPE BLACKBUCK AND INDIAN GAZELLE IN INDIA AND WILD OXEN SUCH AS WILD ASIAN WATER BUFFALO GAUR BANTENG AND KOUPREY ONE WAY THAT DIFFERENT HERBIVORES CAN SURVIVE TOGETHER IN A GIVEN AREA IS FOR EACH SPECIES TO HAVE DIFFERENT FOOD PREFERENCES ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME OVERLAPAUSTRALIA HAS SIX INTRODUCED SPECIES OF DEER THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED SUSTAINABLE WILD POPULATIONS FROM ACCLIMATISATION SOCIETY RELEASES IN THE TH CENTURY THESE ARE THE FALLOW DEER RED DEER SAMBAR HOG DEER RUSA AND CHITAL RED DEER INTRODUCED INTO NEW ZEALAND IN  FROM ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH STOCK WERE DOMESTICATED IN DEER FARMS BY THE LATE S AND ARE COMMON FARM ANIMALS THERE NOW SEVEN OTHER SPECIES OF DEER WERE INTRODUCED INTO NEW ZEALAND BUT NONE ARE AS WIDESPREAD AS RED DEER
