IN BOTANY A TREE IS A PERENNIAL PLANT WITH AN ELONGATED STEM OR TRUNK SUPPORTING BRANCHES AND LEAVES IN MOST SPECIES IN SOME USAGES THE DEFINITION OF A TREE MAY BE NARROWER INCLUDING ONLY WOODY PLANTS WITH SECONDARY GROWTH PLANTS THAT ARE USABLE AS LUMBER OR PLANTS ABOVE A SPECIFIED HEIGHT TREES ARE NOT A TAXONOMIC GROUP BUT INCLUDE A VARIETY OF PLANT SPECIES THAT HAVE INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED A WOODY TRUNK AND BRANCHES AS A WAY TO TOWER ABOVE OTHER PLANTS TO COMPETE FOR SUNLIGHT TREES TEND TO BE LONGLIVED SOME REACHING SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS OLD IN WIDER DEFINITIONS THE TALLER PALMS TREE FERNS BANANAS AND BAMBOOS ARE ALSO TREES TREES HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR  MILLION YEARS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE JUST OVER  TRILLION MATURE TREES IN THE WORLDA TREE TYPICALLY HAS MANY SECONDARY BRANCHES SUPPORTED CLEAR OF THE GROUND BY THE TRUNK THIS TRUNK TYPICALLY CONTAINS WOODY TISSUE FOR STRENGTH AND VASCULAR TISSUE TO CARRY MATERIALS FROM ONE PART OF THE TREE TO ANOTHER FOR MOST TREES IT IS SURROUNDED BY A LAYER OF BARK WHICH SERVES AS A PROTECTIVE BARRIER BELOW THE GROUND THE ROOTS BRANCH AND SPREAD OUT WIDELY THEY SERVE TO ANCHOR THE TREE AND EXTRACT MOISTURE AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE SOIL ABOVE GROUND THE BRANCHES DIVIDE INTO SMALLER BRANCHES AND SHOOTS THE SHOOTS TYPICALLY BEAR LEAVES WHICH CAPTURE LIGHT ENERGY AND CONVERT IT INTO SUGARS BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS PROVIDING THE FOOD FOR THE TREES GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENTTREES USUALLY REPRODUCE USING SEEDS FLOWERS AND FRUIT MAY BE PRESENT BUT SOME TREES SUCH AS CONIFERS INSTEAD HAVE POLLEN CONES AND SEED CONES PALMS BANANAS AND BAMBOOS ALSO PRODUCE SEEDS BUT TREE FERNS PRODUCE SPORES INSTEADTREES PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN REDUCING EROSION AND MODERATING THE CLIMATE THEY REMOVE CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND STORE LARGE QUANTITIES OF CARBON IN THEIR TISSUES TREES AND FORESTS PROVIDE A HABITAT FOR MANY SPECIES OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS TROPICAL RAINFORESTS ARE AMONG THE MOST BIODIVERSE HABITATS IN THE WORLD TREES PROVIDE SHADE AND SHELTER TIMBER FOR CONSTRUCTION FUEL FOR COOKING AND HEATING AND FRUIT FOR FOOD AS WELL AS HAVING MANY OTHER USES IN PARTS OF THE WORLD FORESTS ARE SHRINKING AS TREES ARE CLEARED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF LAND AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE BECAUSE OF THEIR LONGEVITY AND USEFULNESS TREES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN REVERED WITH SACRED GROVES IN VARIOUS CULTURES AND THEY PLAY A ROLE IN MANY OF THE WORLDS MYTHOLOGIESALTHOUGH TREE IS A TERM OF COMMON PARLANCE THERE IS NO UNIVERSALLY RECOGNISED PRECISE DEFINITION OF WHAT A TREE IS EITHER BOTANICALLY OR IN COMMON LANGUAGE IN ITS BROADEST SENSE A TREE IS ANY PLANT WITH THE GENERAL FORM OF AN ELONGATED STEM OR TRUNK WHICH SUPPORTS THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC LEAVES OR BRANCHES AT SOME DISTANCE ABOVE THE GROUND TREES ARE ALSO TYPICALLY DEFINED BY HEIGHT WITH SMALLER PLANTS FROM  TO  M  TO  FT BEING CALLED SHRUBS SO THE MINIMUM HEIGHT OF A TREE IS ONLY LOOSELY DEFINED LARGE HERBACEOUS PLANTS SUCH AS PAPAYA AND BANANAS ARE TREES IN THIS BROAD SENSEA COMMONLY APPLIED NARROWER DEFINITION IS THAT A TREE HAS A WOODY TRUNK FORMED BY SECONDARY GROWTH MEANING THAT THE TRUNK THICKENS EACH YEAR BY GROWING OUTWARDS IN ADDITION TO THE PRIMARY UPWARDS GROWTH FROM THE GROWING TIP UNDER SUCH A DEFINITION HERBACEOUS PLANTS SUCH AS PALMS BANANAS AND PAPAYAS ARE NOT CONSIDERED TREES REGARDLESS OF THEIR HEIGHT GROWTH FORM OR STEM GIRTH CERTAIN MONOCOTS MAY BE CONSIDERED TREES UNDER A SLIGHTLY LOOSER DEFINITION WHILE THE JOSHUA TREE BAMBOOS AND PALMS DO NOT HAVE SECONDARY GROWTH AND NEVER PRODUCE TRUE WOOD WITH GROWTH RINGS THEY MAY PRODUCE PSEUDOWOOD BY LIGNIFYING CELLS FORMED BY PRIMARY GROWTHASIDE FROM STRUCTURAL DEFINITIONS TREES ARE COMMONLY DEFINED BY USE FOR INSTANCE AS THOSE PLANTS WHICH YIELD LUMBERTHE TREE GROWTH HABIT IS AN EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION FOUND IN DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PLANTS BY GROWING TALLER TREES ARE ABLE TO COMPETE BETTER FOR SUNLIGHT TREES TEND TO BE TALL AND LONGLIVED SOME REACHING SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS OLD SEVERAL TREES ARE AMONG THE OLDEST ORGANISMS NOW LIVING TREES HAVE MODIFIED STRUCTURES SUCH AS THICKER STEMS COMPOSED OF SPECIALISED CELLS THAT ADD STRUCTURAL STRENGTH AND DURABILITY ALLOWING THEM TO GROW TALLER THAN MANY OTHER PLANTS AND TO SPREAD OUT THEIR FOLIAGE THEY DIFFER FROM SHRUBS WHICH HAVE A SIMILAR GROWTH FORM BY USUALLY GROWING LARGER AND HAVING A SINGLE MAIN STEM BUT THERE IS NO CONSISTENT DISTINCTION BETWEEN A TREE AND A SHRUB MADE MORE CONFUSING BY THE FACT THAT TREES MAY BE REDUCED IN SIZE UNDER HARSHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS ON MOUNTAINS AND SUBARCTIC AREAS THE TREE FORM HAS EVOLVED SEPARATELY IN UNRELATED CLASSES OF PLANTS IN RESPONSE TO SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES MAKING IT A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF PARALLEL EVOLUTION WITH AN ESTIMATED  SPECIES THE NUMBER OF TREES WORLDWIDE MIGHT TOTAL TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OF ALL LIVING PLANT SPECIES THE GREATEST NUMBER OF THESE GROW IN TROPICAL REGIONS AND MANY OF THESE AREAS HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY SURVEYED BY BOTANISTS MAKING TREE DIVERSITY AND RANGES POORLY KNOWNTALL HERBACEOUS MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS SUCH AS BANANA LACK SECONDARY GROWTH BUT ARE TREES UNDER THE BROADEST DEFINITIONTHE MAJORITY OF TREE SPECIES ARE ANGIOSPERMS THERE ARE ABOUT  SPECIES OF GYMNOSPERM TREES INCLUDING CONIFERS CYCADS GINKGOPHYTES AND GNETALES THEY PRODUCE SEEDS WHICH ARE NOT ENCLOSED IN FRUITS BUT IN OPEN STRUCTURES SUCH AS PINE CONES AND MANY HAVE TOUGH WAXY LEAVES SUCH AS PINE NEEDLES MOST ANGIOSPERM TREES ARE EUDICOTS THE TRUE DICOTYLEDONS SO NAMED BECAUSE THE SEEDS CONTAIN TWO COTYLEDONS OR SEED LEAVES THERE ARE ALSO SOME TREES AMONG THE OLD LINEAGES OF FLOWERING PLANTS CALLED BASAL ANGIOSPERMS OR PALEODICOTS THESE INCLUDE AMBORELLA MAGNOLIA NUTMEG AND AVOCADO WHILE TREES SUCH AS BAMBOO PALMS AND BANANAS ARE MONOCOTSWOOD GIVES STRUCTURAL STRENGTH TO THE TRUNK OF MOST TYPES OF TREE THIS SUPPORTS THE PLANT AS IT GROWS LARGER THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF TREES ALLOWS WATER NUTRIENTS AND OTHER CHEMICALS TO BE DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE PLANT AND WITHOUT IT TREES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GROW AS LARGE AS THEY DO TREES AS RELATIVELY TALL PLANTS NEED TO DRAW WATER UP THE STEM THROUGH THE XYLEM FROM THE ROOTS BY THE SUCTION PRODUCED AS WATER EVAPORATES FROM THE LEAVES IF INSUFFICIENT WATER IS AVAILABLE THE LEAVES WILL DIE THE THREE MAIN PARTS OF TREES INCLUDE THE ROOT STEM AND LEAVES THEY ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM WHICH INTERCONNECTS ALL THE LIVING CELLS IN TREES AND OTHER PLANTS THAT DEVELOP WOOD THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM ALLOWS THE EXPANSION OF VASCULAR TISSUE THAT PRODUCES WOODY GROWTH BECAUSE THIS GROWTH RUPTURES THE EPIDERMIS OF THE STEM WOODY PLANTS ALSO HAVE A CORK CAMBIUM THAT DEVELOPS AMONG THE PHLOEM THE CORK CAMBIUM GIVES RISE TO THICKENED CORK CELLS TO PROTECT THE SURFACE OF THE PLANT AND REDUCE WATER LOSS BOTH THE PRODUCTION OF WOOD AND THE PRODUCTION OF CORK ARE FORMS OF SECONDARY GROWTHTREES ARE EITHER EVERGREEN HAVING FOLIAGE THAT PERSISTS AND REMAINS GREEN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR OR DECIDUOUS SHEDDING THEIR LEAVES AT THE END OF THE GROWING SEASON AND THEN HAVING A DORMANT PERIOD WITHOUT FOLIAGE MOST CONIFERS ARE EVERGREENS BUT LARCHES LARIX AND PSEUDOLARIX ARE DECIDUOUS

SPREADING TOP OF A TREE INCLUDING THE BRANCHES AND LEAVES WHILE THE UPPERMOST LAYER IN A FOREST FORMED BY THE CROWNS OF THE TREES IS KNOWN AS THE CANOPY A SAPLING IS A YOUNG TREEMANY TALL PALMS ARE HERBACEOUS MONOCOTS THESE DO NOT UNDERGO SECONDARY GROWTH AND NEVER PRODUCE WOOD IN MANY TALL PALMS THE TERMINAL BUD ON THE MAIN STEM IS THE ONLY ONE TO DEVELOP SO THEY HAVE UNBRANCHED TRUNKS WITH LARGE SPIRALLY ARRANGED LEAVES SOME OF THE TREE FERNS ORDER CYATHEALES HAVE TALL STRAIGHT TRUNKS GROWING UP TO  METRES  FT BUT THESE ARE COMPOSED NOT OF WOOD BUT OF RHIZOMES WHICH GROW VERTICALLY AND ARE COVERED BY NUMEROUS ADVENTITIOUS ROOTSTHE NUMBER OF TREES IN THE WORLD ACCORDING TO A  ESTIMATE IS  TRILLION OF WHICH  TRILLION  ARE IN THE TROPICS OR SUBTROPICS  TRILLION  IN THE TEMPERATE ZONES AND  TRILLION  IN THE CONIFEROUS BOREAL FORESTS THE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT EIGHT TIMES HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS ESTIMATES AND IS BASED ON TREE DENSITIES MEASURED ON OVER  PLOTS IT REMAINS SUBJECT TO A WIDE MARGIN OF ERROR NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE SAMPLES ARE MAINLY FROM EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA THE ESTIMATE SUGGESTS THAT ABOUT  BILLION TREES ARE CUT DOWN ANNUALLY AND ABOUT  BILLION ARE PLANTED IN THE  YEARS SINCE THE START OF HUMAN AGRICULTURE THE NUMBER OF TREES WORLDWIDE HAS DECREASED BY IN SUITABLE ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS THE DAINTREE RAINFOREST IN QUEENSLAND OR THE MIXED PODOCARP AND BROADLEAF FOREST OF ULVA ISLAND NEW ZEALAND FOREST IS THE MOREORLESS STABLE CLIMATIC CLIMAX COMMUNITY AT THE END OF A PLANT SUCCESSION WHERE OPEN AREAS SUCH AS GRASSLAND ARE COLONISED BY TALLER PLANTS WHICH IN

THE RADICLE OR EMBRYONIC ROOT IS THE FIRST PART OF A SEEDLING TO EMERGE FROM THE SEED DURING THE PROCESS OF GERMINATION THIS DEVELOPS INTO A TAPROOT WHICH GOES STRAIGHT DOWNWARDS WITHIN A FEW WEEKS LATERAL ROOTS BRANCH OUT OF THE SIDE OF THIS AND GROW HORIZONTALLY THROUGH THE UPPER LAYERS OF THE SOIL IN MOST TREES THE TAPROOT EVENTUALLY WITHERS AWAY AND THE WIDESPREADING LATERALS REMAIN NEAR THE TIP OF THE FINER ROOTS ARE SINGLE CELL ROOT HAIRS THESE ARE IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THE SOIL PARTICLES AND CAN ABSORB WATER AND NUTRIENTS SUCH AS POTASSIUM IN SOLUTION THE ROOTS REQUIRE OXYGEN TO RESPIRE AND ONLY A FEW SPECIES SUCH AS THE MANGROVE AND THE POND CYPRESS TAXODIUM ASCENDENS CAN LIVE IN PERMANENTLY WATERLOGGED SOILIN THE SOIL THE ROOTS ENCOUNTER THE HYPHAE OF FUNGI MANY OF THESE ARE KNOWN AS MYCORRHIZA AND FORM A MUTUALISTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TREE ROOTS SOME ARE SPECIFIC TO A SINGLE TREE SPECIES WHICH WILL NOT FLOURISH IN THE ABSENCE OF ITS MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATE OTHERS ARE GENERALISTS AND ASSOCIATE WITH MANY SPECIES THE TREE ACQUIRES MINERALS SUCH AS PHOSPHORUS FROM THE FUNGUS WHILE IT OBTAINS THE CARBOHYDRATE PRODUCTS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS FROM THE TREE THE HYPHAE OF THE FUNGUS CAN LINK DIFFERENT TREES AND A NETWORK IS FORMED TRANSFERRING NUTRIENTS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER THE FUNGUS PROMOTES GROWTH OF THE ROOTS AND HELPS PROTECT THE TREES AGAINST PREDATORS AND PATHOGENS IT CAN ALSO LIMIT DAMAGE DONE TO A TREE BY POLLUTION AS THE FUNGUS ACCUMULATE HEAVY METALS WITHIN ITS TISSUES FOSSIL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ROOTS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI

BACTERIA LIVE THIS PROCESS ENABLES THE TREE TO LIVE IN LOW NITROGEN HABITATS WHERE THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNABLE TO THRIVE THE PLANT HORMONES CALLED CYTOKININS INITIATE ROOT NODULE FORMATION IN A PROCESS CLOSELY RELATED TO MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATIONIT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT SOME TREES ARE INTERCONNECTED THROUGH THEIR ROOT SYSTEM FORMING A COLONY THE INTERCONNECTIONS ARE MADE BY THE INOSCULATION PROCESS A KIND OF NATURAL GRAFTING OR WELDING OF VEGETAL TISSUES THE TESTS TO DEMONSTRATE THIS NETWORKING ARE PERFORMED BY INJECTING CHEMICALS SOMETIMES RADIOACTIVE INTO A TREE AND THEN CHECKING FOR ITS PRESENCE IN NEIGHBOURING TREESTHE ROOTS ARE GENERALLY AN UNDERGROUND PART OF THE TREE BUT SOME TREE SPECIES HAVE EVOLVED ROOTS THAT ARE AERIAL THE COMMON PURPOSES FOR AERIAL ROOTS MAY BE OF TWO KINDS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MECHANICAL STABILITY OF THE TREE AND TO OBTAIN OXYGEN FROM AIR AN INSTANCE OF MECHANICAL STABILITY ENHANCEMENT IS THE RED MANGROVE THAT DEVELOPS PROP ROOTS THAT LOOP OUT OF THE TRUNK AND BRANCHES AND DESCEND VERTICALLY INTO THE MUD A SIMILAR STRUCTURE IS DEVELOPED BY THE INDIAN BANYAN MANY LARGE TREES HAVE BUTTRESS ROOTS WHICH FLARE OUT FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE TRUNK THESE BRACE THE TREE RATHER LIKE ANGLE BRACKETS AND PROVIDE STABILITY REDUCING SWAY IN HIGH WINDS THEY ARE PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN TROPICAL RAINFORESTS WHERE THE SOIL IS POOR AND THE ROOTS ARE CLOSE TO THE SURFACESOME TREE SPECIES HAVE DEVELOPED ROOT EXTENSIONS THAT POP OUT OF SOIL IN ORDER TO GET OXYGEN WHEN IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE SOIL BECAUSE OF EXCESS WATER THESE ROOT EXTENSIONS ARE CALLED PNEUMATOPHORES AND ARE PRESENT AMONG OTHERS IN BLACK MANGROVE AND POND CYPRESSTHE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE TRUNK IS TO RAISE THE LEAVES ABOVE THE GROUND ENABLING THE TREE TO OVERTOP OTHER PLANTS AND OUTCOMPETE THEM FOR LIGHT IT ALSO TRANSPORTS WATER AND NUTRIENTS FROM THE ROOTS TO THE AERIAL PARTS OF THE TREE AND DISTRIBUTES THE FOOD PRODUCED BY THE LEAVES TO ALL OTHER PARTS INCLUDING THE ROOTSIN THE CASE OF ANGIOSPERMS AND GYMNOSPERMS THE OUTERMOST LAYER OF THE TRUNK IS THE BARK MOSTLY COMPOSED OF DEAD CELLS OF PHELLEM CORK IT PROVIDES A THICK WATERPROOF COVERING TO THE LIVING INNER TISSUE IT PROTECTS THE TRUNK AGAINST THE ELEMENTS DISEASE ANIMAL ATTACK AND FIRE IT IS PERFORATED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF FINE BREATHING PORES CALLED LENTICELS THROUGH WHICH OXYGEN DIFFUSES BARK IS
