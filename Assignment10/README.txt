I have not collaboraed with anyone in this class or outside this class.
I have not used any modules from text book
I have also not watched any videos or referred to any websites while doing this assisngmnet. 

Some side notes:
	If all 10 language sample files are included, it takes about 3 minutes for cache
	for SSDs (Problem 1) and less than a minute for DPD (Problem 2).

	In total, with both methods and all 10 languages, it takes about 4 minutes total.

Please let me know if more info in needed. Thank you for taking the time to read this :)
